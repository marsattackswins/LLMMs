## [How can I prevent the “Bar index value of the \`x\` argument is too far from the current bar index. Try using \`time\` instead” and “Objects positioned using xloc.bar\_index cannot be drawn further than X bars into the future” errors?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#how-can-i-prevent-the-bar-index-value-of-the-x-argument-is-too-far-from-the-current-bar-index-try-using-time-instead-and-objects-positioned-using-xlocbar_index-cannot-be-drawn-further-than-x-bars-into-the-future-errors)

Both these errors occur when creating objects too distant from the current bar. An x point on a [line](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/lines-and-boxes/#lines), [label](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/text-and-shapes/#labels), or [box](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/lines-and-boxes/#boxes) can not be more than 9999 bars in the past or more than 500 bars in the future relative to the bar on which the script draws it.

Scripts _can_ draw objects beyond these limits, however, using [xloc.bar\_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_xloc.bar_time) instead of the `xloc` parameter, and [time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_time) as an alternative to [bar\_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index) for the `x` arguments.

Note that, by default, all drawings use `xloc.bar_index`, which means that the values passed to their `x`\-coordinates are treated as if they are bar indices. If drawings use a `time`\-based value without specifying `xloc = xloc.bar_time`, the timestamp — which is usually an `int` value of trillions of milliseconds — is treated as an index of a bar in the future, and inevitably exceeds the 500 future bars limit. To use `time`\-based values for drawings, always specify `xloc.bar_time`.

## [How can I update the right side of all lines or boxes?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#how-can-i-update-the-right-side-of-all-lines-or-boxes)

Scripts can update the `x2` value of all lines or boxes by storing them in an array and using a [for…in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_for...in) loop to iterate over each object. Update the `x2` value using the [line.set\_x2()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_line.set_x2) or [box.set\_right()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_box.set_right) functions.

In the example below, we create a custom array and go over it to extend lines with each new bar:

//@version=6 indicator("Update x2 demo", "", true) int activeLevelsInput = input.int(10, "Number of levels") int pivotLegsInput = input.int(5, "Pivot length") // Save pivot prices. float pHi = ta.pivothigh(pivotLegsInput, pivotLegsInput) // Initialize an array for lines on the first bar, sized to match the number of levels to track. var array<line> pivotLines = array.new<line>(activeLevelsInput) // Check for a pivot. Add a new line to the array. Remove and delete the oldest line. if not na(pHi) line newPivotLine = line.new(bar\_index\[pivotLegsInput\], pHi, bar\_index, pHi) pivotLines.push(newPivotLine) pivotLines.shift().delete() // Update all line x2 values. if barstate.islast for eachLine in pivotLines eachLine.set\_x2(bar\_index)

As an alternative to adding new drawings to a custom array, scripts can use the appropriate built-in variable that collects all instances of a drawing type. These arrays use the `<drawingNamespace>.all` naming scheme: for example, scritps can access all drawn labels by referring to [label.all](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_label.all), all polylines with [polyline.all](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_polyline.all), etc. Scripts can iterate over these arrays in the same way as with custom arrays.

This example implements gets the same result using the [line.all](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_line.all) built-in array instead:

//@version=6 indicator("Update x2 demo", "", true) int activeLevelsInput = input.int(10, "Number of levels") int pivotLegsInput = input.int(5, "Pivot length") // Save pivot prices. float pHi = ta.pivothigh(pivotLegsInput, pivotLegsInput) // Check for a pivot. Delete the oldest line if the array is over the "Number of levels" limit. if not na(pHi) line newPivotLine = line.new(bar\_index\[pivotLegsInput\], pHi, bar\_index, pHi) if line.all.size() > activeLevelsInput line.all.first().delete() // Update all line x2 values. if barstate.islast for eachLine in line.all eachLine.set\_x2(bar\_index)

## [How to avoid repainting when not using the \`request.security()\` function?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#how-to-avoid-repainting-when-not-using-the-requestsecurity-function)

Scripts can give deceptive output if they [repaint](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/repainting/) by behaving differently on historical and elapsed realtime bars. This type of repainting is most commonly caused by requesting data from another context using the [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) function.

Scripts can also change their output during a realtime bar, as the [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume), [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close), [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high), and [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low) values change. This form of repainting is not normally deceptive or detrimental.

To avoid this kind of repainting and ensure that outputs do not change during a bar, consider the following options:

-   Use confirmed values, or the values from the previous bar.
-   Set alerts to fire on bar close. Read more about repainting alerts in the FAQ entry [Why is my alert firing at the wrong time?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/alerts/#why-is-my-alert-firing-at-the-wrong-time)
-   Use the [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open) in calculations instead of the [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close).

For further exploration of these methods, see the PineCoders publication [“How to avoid repainting when NOT using security()“](https://www.tradingview.com/script/s8kWs84i-How-to-avoid-repainting-when-NOT-using-security/).

## [How can I trigger a condition n bars after it last occurred?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#how-can-i-trigger-a-condition-n-bars-after-it-last-occurred)

Using the [ta.barssince()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.barssince) function, scripts can implement a condition when a certain number of bars have elapsed since the last occurrence of that condition.

The following example script uses the `cond` condition to plot a blue star when the [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) value is greater than the [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open) value for two consecutive bars. Then, the `trigger` variable is true only if the `cond` condition is already true _and_ the number of bars elapsed since `cond` was last true is greater than `lengthInput`. The script plots a red “O” on the chart, overlaying the blue star, each time these conditions are met. The Data Window displays the count since `cond` was last true.

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Techniques-How-can-i-trigger-a-condition-only-when-a-number-of-bars-have-elapsed-since-the-last-condition-occured-1.Dt02f4F1_Zi4RzG.webp)

//@version=6 indicator("\`barssince\` demo", overlay = true) int lengthInput = input.int(3, "Length") bool cond = close > open and close\[1\] > open\[1\] int count = ta.barssince(cond\[1\]) + 1 bool trigger = cond and count > lengthInput plot(cond ? 0 : count, "Count", display = display.data\_window) plotchar(cond) plotchar(trigger, "", "O", color = color.red)

## [How can my script identify what chart type is active?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#how-can-my-script-identify-what-chart-type-is-active)

Various boolean [built-in](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/built-ins/) variables within the `chart.*` namespace enable a script to detect the type of chart it is running on.

The following example script defines a function, `chartTypeToString()`, which uses the `chart.*` built-ins to identify the chart type and convert this information into a string. It then displays the detected chart type in a table on the chart.

//@version=6 indicator("Chart type", "", true) chartTypeToString() => string result = switch chart.is\_standard => "Standard" chart.is\_heikinashi => "Heikin-Ashi" chart.is\_kagi => "Kagi" chart.is\_linebreak => "Line Break" chart.is\_pnf => "Point and Figure" chart.is\_range => "Range" chart.is\_renko => "Renko" if barstate.islastconfirmedhistory var table display = table.new(position.bottom\_right, 1, 1, bgcolor = chart.fg\_color) table.cell(display, 0, 0, str.format("Chart type: {0}", chartTypeToString()), text\_color = chart.bg\_color)

## [How can I plot the highest and lowest visible candle values?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#how-can-i-plot-the-highest-and-lowest-visible-candle-values)

To plot the highest [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) and lowest [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low) within the range of visible bars, a script can use the [chart.left\_visible\_bar\_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.left_visible_bar_time) and [chart.right\_visible\_bar\_time](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_chart.right_visible_bar_time) built-ins. These variables allow the script to identify the times of the earliest and latest visible bars on the chart and calculate the maximum or minimum values within that range.

The [VisibleChart](https://www.tradingview.com/script/j7vCseM2-VisibleChart/) library by [PineCoders](https://www.tradingview.com/u/PineCoders/) offers such functionality with its `high()` and `low()` functions, which dynamically calculate the highest and lowest values of the currently visible bars.

The following example script uses functions from this library to create two horizontal [lines](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/lines-and-boxes/#lines) on the chart, signifying the highest and lowest price points within the range of visible bars. The script draws [labels](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/text-and-shapes/#labels) for these lines, displaying both the price and the corresponding timestamp for each high and low point. As the chart is manipulated through scrolling or zooming, these lines and labels dynamically update to reflect the highest and lowest values of the newly visible bars:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Techniques-How-can-i-plot-the-charts-visible-high-and-low-1.C8tRKhQr_Z2todXY.webp)

//@version=6 indicator("Chart's visible high/low", "", true) import PineCoders/VisibleChart/4 as PCvc // Calculate the chart's visible high and low prices and their corresponding times. int x1 = PCvc.highBarTime() int x2 = PCvc.lowBarTime() float chartHi = PCvc.high() float chartLo = PCvc.low() // Draw lines and labels on the last bar. if barstate.islast line.new(x1, chartHi, x2, chartHi, xloc.bar\_time, extend.both, color.lime) line.new(x1, chartLo, x2, chartLo, xloc.bar\_time, extend.both, color.fuchsia) string hiTxt = str.format("{0}\\n{1}", str.tostring(chartHi, format.mintick), str.format\_time(x1, format = "dd/MM/yy @ HH:mm")) string loTxt = str.format("{0}\\n{1}", str.tostring(chartLo, format.mintick), str.format\_time(x2, format = "dd/MM/yy @ HH:mm")) label.new(x1, chartHi, hiTxt, xloc.bar\_time, yloc.price, color.new(color.lime, 80), label.style\_label\_down, color.lime) label.new(x2, chartLo, loTxt, xloc.bar\_time, yloc.price, color.new(color.fuchsia, 80), label.style\_label\_up, color.fuchsia)

**Note that:**

-   Values derived from visible chart variables can change throughout the script’s runtime. To accurately reflect the entire visible range, the script defers drawing the lines until the last bar (using [barstate.islast](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.islast)).
-   Because the visible chart values are defined in the [global scope](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/programming/#what-does-scope-mean), _outside_ the local block defined by [barstate.islast](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_barstate.islast), the functions process the entire dataset before determining the final high and low values.

For more information, refer to the [VisibleChart](https://www.tradingview.com/script/j7vCseM2-VisibleChart/) library’s documentation.

## [How to remember the last time a condition occurred?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#how-to-remember-the-last-time-a-condition-occurred)

Scripts can store the number of bars between the current bar and a bar on which a condition occurred in various ways:

-   Using [ta.barssince()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.barssince). This built-in function is the simplest way to track the distance from the condition.
-   Manually replicating the functionality of [ta.barssince()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.barssince) by initializing the distance to zero when the condition occurs, then incrementing it by one on each bar, resetting it if the condition occurs again.
-   Saving the [bar\_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index) when the condition occurs, and calculating the difference from the current [bar\_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index).

Programmers can then use the number of bars with the [history-referencing operator \[\]](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#op_%5B%5D) to retrieve the value of a variable, such as the [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close), on that bar.

Alternatively, if the script needs _only_ the value itself and not the number of bars, simply save the value each time the condition occurs. This method is more efficient because it avoids referencing the series multiple times throughout its history. This method also reduces the risk of runtime errors in scripts if the size of the historical reference is [too large](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/error-messages/#pine-script-cannot-determine-the-referencing-length-of-a-series-try-using-max_bars_back-in-the-indicator-or-strategy-function).

Here’s a script that demonstrates these methods:

//@version=6 indicator("Track distance from condition", "", true) // Plot the high/low from the bar where a condition occurred the last time. // Conditions bool upBar = close > open bool dnBar = close < open bool up3Bars = dnBar and upBar\[1\] and upBar\[2\] and upBar\[3\] bool dn3Bars = upBar and dnBar\[1\] and dnBar\[2\] and dnBar\[3\] display = display.data\_window // Method 1: Using "ta.barssince()". plot(high\[ta.barssince(up3Bars)\], color = color.new(color.blue, 80), linewidth = 16) plot(low\[ta.barssince(dn3Bars)\], color = color.new(color.red, 80), linewidth = 16) plot(ta.barssince(up3Bars), "1. ta.barssince(up3Bars)", display = display) plot(ta.barssince(dn3Bars), "1. ta.barssince(dn3Bars)", display = display) // Method 2: Manually replicating the functionality of the "ta.barssince()" function. var int barsFromUp = na var int barsFromDn = na barsFromUp := up3Bars ? 0 : barsFromUp + 1 barsFromDn := dn3Bars ? 0 : barsFromDn + 1 plot(high\[barsFromUp\], color = color.blue, linewidth = 3) plot(low\[barsFromDn\], color = color.red, linewidth = 3) plot(barsFromUp, "3. barsFromUp", display = display) plot(barsFromDn, "3. barsFromDn", display = display) // Method 3: Storing the \`bar\_index\` value when a condition is met. var int barWhenUp = na var int barWhenDn = na if up3Bars barWhenUp := bar\_index if dn3Bars barWhenDn := bar\_index plot(high\[bar\_index - barWhenUp\], color = color.new(color.blue, 70), linewidth = 8) plot(low\[bar\_index - barWhenDn\], color = color.new(color.red, 70), linewidth = 8) plot(bar\_index - barWhenUp, "2. bar\_index - barWhenUp", display = display) plot(bar\_index - barWhenDn, "2. bar\_index - barWhenDn", display = display) // Method 4: Storing the value when a condition is met. var float highWhenUp = na var float lowWhenDn = na if up3Bars highWhenUp := high if dn3Bars lowWhenDn := low plot(highWhenUp, color = color.new(color.white, 70), linewidth = 1) plot(lowWhenDn, color = color.new(color.white, 70), linewidth = 1)

## [How can I plot the previous and current day’s open?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#how-can-i-plot-the-previous-and-current-days-open)

There are several methods for plotting prices from a higher timeframe (we assume that these scripts are to be run on intraday timeframes).

### [Using \`timeframe.change()\`](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#using-timeframechange)

The [timeframe.change()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_timeframe.change) function identifies when a bar in a specified timeframe opens. When a new daily bar opens, the following example script first copies the existing daily opening value to the variable for the previous day, and then updates the opening price for the current day.

//@version=6 indicator("Previous and current day open using \`timeframe.change()\`", "", true) bool newDay = timeframe.change("1D") var float yesterdayOpen = na var float todayOpen = na if newDay yesterdayOpen := todayOpen // We reassign this value first todayOpen := open // and then store today's open plot(yesterdayOpen, "Yesterday's Open", newDay ? na : color.red, 2, plot.style\_line) plot(todayOpen, "Today's Open", newDay ? na : color.green, 2, plot.style\_line) bgcolor(newDay ? color.new(color.gray, 80) : na)

**Note that:**

-   This method uses the chart’s timeframe transitions to establish open prices and does not make adjustments for session times.
-   For some markets and instrument types, the intraday data and the daily data is expected to differ. For example, the US exchanges like NASDAQ and NYSE include more trades in daily bars than in intraday ones, which results in different OHLC values between intraday and daily data, and in daily volume being far greater than intraday one. As a result, the first [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open) of a trading session on an intraday chart can differ from the [open](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_open) of its respective 1D candle.

### [Using \`request.security()\`](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#using-requestsecurity)

To match the values on the chart with the values on higher timeframe charts, it’s necessary to access the higher timeframe data feeds. Scripts can achieve this by using the [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) function.

The following example script requests two data feeds from a higher timeframe. To reduce the risk of [repainting](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/repainting/), we use only confirmed values for historical bars. The script plots confirmed values retroactively on each preceding day when a new day begins. For the real-time bar of the higher timeframe, which represents the current day, we draw a separate set of lines. The realtime lines can change during the day. While this type of repainting is not apparent here when using the opening price, which does not change after the bar opens, it is more obvious for scripts that use the closing price, which takes the current price until the bar closes.

//@version=6 indicator("Previous and current day open using \`request.security()\`", "", true, max\_lines\_count = 500) string periodInput = input.timeframe("1D", "Higher timeframe") \[htfOpen1, htfOpen2, htfTime, htfTimeClose\] = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, periodInput, \[open\[1\], open\[2\], time\[1\], time\_close\[1\]\], lookahead = barmerge.lookahead\_on) \[htfRtOpen, htfRtOpen1\] = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, periodInput, \[open, open\[1\]\]) var line rtOpen = line.new(na, na, na, na, xloc.bar\_time, color = color.lime) var line rtOpen1 = line.new(na, na, na, na, xloc.bar\_time, color = color.gray) var int rtStart = time var int rtEnd = time\_close(periodInput) if ta.change(htfTime) line.new(htfTime, htfOpen1, htfTimeClose, htfOpen1, xloc.bar\_time, color = color.lime) line.new(htfTime, htfOpen2, htfTimeClose, htfOpen2, xloc.bar\_time, color = color.gray) rtStart := time rtEnd := time\_close(periodInput) line.set\_xy1(rtOpen1, rtStart, htfRtOpen1), line.set\_xy2(rtOpen1, rtEnd, htfRtOpen1) line.set\_xy1(rtOpen, rtStart, htfRtOpen), line.set\_xy2(rtOpen, rtEnd, htfRtOpen) bgcolor(timeframe.change(periodInput) ? color.new(color.gray, 80) : na)

### [Using \`timeframe\`](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#using-timeframe)

Instead of writing custom logic to retrieve or calculate prices for a particular timeframe, programmers can run the entire script in that timeframe.

If scripts include the `timeframe` parameter in the [indicator](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_indicator) declaration, the user can choose the timeframe in which the script runs. The script can set a default timeframe.

By default, the following script plots the current and previous day’s opening prices, similar to the previous examples. It is much simpler, but behaves quite differently. For historical bars, the script returns values when the day closes, effectively one day “late”. For realtime and elapsed realtime bars, the script returns live values, if the option “Wait for timeframe closes” is not selected in the script settings.

//@version=6 indicator("Previous and current day open using \`timeframe\`", "", true, timeframe = "1D", timeframe\_gaps = true) plot(open\[1\], "Yesterday's Open", color.red, 2, plot.style\_line) plot(open, "Today's Open", color.green, 2, plot.style\_line)

**Note that:**

-   Only simple scripts that do not use drawings can use the `timeframe` parameter.
-   Scripts that use the `timeframe` parameter can plot values quite differently depending on which settings are chosen. For an explanation, see [this Help Center article](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000591555/).

## [How can I count the occurrences of a condition in the last x bars?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#how-can-i-count-the-occurrences-of-a-condition-in-the-last-x-bars)

One obvious method is to use a [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loop to retrospectively review each of the last x bars and check for the condition. However, this method is inefficient, because it examines all bars in range _again_ on every bar, even though it already examined all but the last bar.

In general, using unnecessary, large, or nested [for](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_for) loops can result in slower processing and longer chart loading times.

The simplest and most efficient method is to use the built-in [math.sum()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.sum) function, and pass it a conditional series to count. This function maintains a running total of the count as each bar is processed, and can take a [simple](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#simple) or [series](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#series) length.

The following example script uses both of these calculation methods. It also uses a series length that adjusts for the first part of the chart, where the number of bars available is less than the length. This way, the functions do not return [na](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_na) values.

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Techniques-How-can-i-count-the-occurences-of-a-condition-in-the-last-x-bars-1.DjfPEBjE_Z2kXwuv.webp)

//@version=6 indicator("Number of occurrences demo", overlay = false) int lengthInput = input.int(100, "Length", minval = 1) // Condition to count. bool isUpBar = close > open // Count using a loop (inefficient). countWithLoop(bool condition, int length) => int count = 0 for i = 0 to length - 1 if condition\[i\] count += 1 count // Count using Pine's built-in function. Can be "simple" or "series" length. countWithSum(bool condition, int length) => float result = math.sum(condition ? 1 : 0, length) float v1 = countWithSum(isUpBar, math.min(lengthInput, bar\_index + 1)) int v2 = countWithLoop(isUpBar, math.min(lengthInput, bar\_index + 1)) plot(v1, "Efficient count", color.red, 4) plot(v2, "Inefficient count", color.black, 1)

## [How can I implement an on/off switch?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#how-can-i-implement-an-onoff-switch)

An on/off switch is a persistent state that can be turned on once, and persists across bars until it is turned off. Scripts can use the [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/variable-declarations/#var) keyword to initialize a variable only once, and maintain its most recent value across subsequent bars unless it is reassigned. Such persistent states can be boolean values, or integers, or any other type.

The following example script show how to implement this. Each instance of the on and off triggers displays with an arrow and the word “On” or “Off”. A green background highlights the bars where the switch is in the “On” state.

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Techniques-How-can-i-implement-an-on-off-switch-1.B-YIPmBl_2lBAJC.webp)

//@version=6 indicator("On/Off condition example", overlay = true) bool upBar = close > open // On/off conditions. bool triggerOn = upBar and upBar\[1\] and upBar\[2\] bool triggerOff = not upBar and not upBar\[1\] // Switch state is saved across bars. var bool onOffSwitch = false // Turn the switch on or off, otherwise persist its state. onOffSwitch := triggerOn ? true : triggerOff ? false : onOffSwitch bgcolor(onOffSwitch ? color.new(color.green, 90) : na) plotchar(triggerOn, "triggerOn", "▲", location.belowbar, color.lime, size = size.tiny, text = "On") plotchar(triggerOff, "triggerOff", "▼", location.abovebar, color.red, size = size.tiny, text = "Off")

## [How can I alternate conditions?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#how-can-i-alternate-conditions)

Scripts can alternate from one state to another strictly, even when the triggers to change state do not occur in strict order. This can be useful to mark only the first trigger and not any subsequent triggers, or to prevent multiple alerts.

The following example script plots all pivots, defined by Williams fractals. These pivots can occur in any order. The script stores the type of the most recent pivot, and confirms the next pivot _only_ if it is of the opposite type, such that confirmed pivots appear strictly high-low-high or low-high-low, etc. Confirmed pivots are plotted in a larger size and different color. The chart background color is colored according to the type of the most recent confirmed pivot.

PivotType.high : lastPivot // Color the background of the chart based on the direction of the most recent confirmed pivot. bgcolor(lastPivot == PivotType.low ? green80 : lastPivot == PivotType.high ? red80 : lastPivot == PivotType.undefined ? yellow80 : na)

**Note that:**

-   The script uses an [enum](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/enums/#enums) variable with three possible values to store the type of the last pivot and to decide whether to confirm subsequent pivots.
-   A single boolean value cannot reliably do this, because boolean values [can only be `true` or `false` and not `na`](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/migration-guides/to-pine-version-6/#boolean-values-cannot-be-na). Using a boolean value can cause unexpected behavior, for example, at the beginning of the chart history where no trigger condition has occurred.
-   A pair of boolean variables can replicate this behavior, with careful handling. See the FAQ entry [“How can I accumulate a value for two exclusive states?”](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#how-can-i-accumulate-a-value-for-two-exclusive-states) for an example of using two boolean values in this way.
-   A string variable can also do the same thing. The advantage of an [enum](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/enums/#enums) over a string is that all possible allowed values are known, thus avoiding the case where a condition tests for a value that is misspelled, outdated or otherwise not relevant. Such a test silently fails in every possible case, and the corresponding logic never runs. Such tests can therefore cause bugs that are difficult to find.

## [Can I merge two or more indicators into one?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#can-i-merge-two-or-more-indicators-into-one)

It is possible to combine indicators, paying attention to the following points:

-   Ensure that the scales that the indicators use are compatible, or re-scale them to be compatible. For example, combining a moving average indicator, designed to overlay the bar chart, with a volume bar indicator that’s meant for a separate indicator pane is unlikely to display as expected.
-   Check that variable names do not overlap.
-   Convert each script to the most recent version of Pine Script™, or at least the same version, before combining them.
-   Ensure that there is only one version declaration and script declaration in the resulting script.

## [How can I rescale an indicator from one scale to another?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#how-can-i-rescale-an-indicator-from-one-scale-to-another)

Rescaling an indicator from one scale to another means trying to ensure that the values display within a similar range to other values, from the same indicator or from the chart.

For example, consider a script that displays volume typically measuring in the millions of units, and also RSI, which ranges from zero to one hundred. If the script displays these values in the same pane, the volume is visible but the RSI will be so small as to be unreadable.

Where values are dissimilar like this, they must be _rescaled_ or _normalized_:

-   If the minimum and maximum possible values are known, or _bounded_, the values can be _rescaled_, that is, adjusted to a new range bounded by different maximum and minimum values. Each value differs in absolute terms, but retains the same _relative_ proportion to other rescaled values.
-   If the values are _unbounded_, meaning that either the maximum or minimum values, or both, are not known, they must instead be _normalized_. Normalizing means scaling the values relative to historical maximum and minimum values. Because the maximum and minimum historical values can change over time as the script runs on more historical and realtime bars, the new scale is _dynamic_ and therefore the new values are _not_ exactly proportional to each other.

The example script below uses a `rescale()` function to rescale RSI values, and a `normalize()` function to normalize [Commodity Channel Index (CCI)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.cci) and [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume) values. Although normalizing is an imperfect solution, it is more complete than using [ta.lowest()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.lowest) and [ta.highest()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.highest), because it uses the minimum and maximum values for the complete set of elapsed bars instead of a subset of fixed length.

//@version=6 indicator("Rescaling and normalizing values", "", overlay = false) // @function Rescales a signal with a known scale (bounded) to a new scale. // @param src (series float) The series to rescale. // @param oldMin (simple float) The minimum value of the original signal's scale. // @param oldMax (simple float) The maximum value of the original signal's scale. // @param newMin (simple float) The minimum value of the new scale. // @param newMax (simple float) The maximum value of the new scale. // @returns (float) The rescaled value of the signal. rescale(series float src, simple float oldMin, simple float oldMax, simple float newMin, simple float newMax) => float result = newMin + (newMax - newMin) \* (src - oldMin) / math.max(oldMax - oldMin, 10e-10) // @function Rescales a signal with an unknown scale (unbounded) using its historical low and high values. // @param src (series float) The series to rescale. // @param min (simple float) The minimum value of the rescaled series. // @param max (simple float) The maximum value of the rescaled series. // @returns (float) The rescaled value of the signal. normalize(series float src, simple float min, simple float max) => var float historicMin = 10e10 var float historicMax = -10e10 historicMin := math.min(nz(src, historicMin), historicMin) historicMax := math.max(nz(src, historicMax), historicMax) float result = min + (max - min) \* (src - historicMin) / math.max(historicMax - historicMin, 10e-10) // ————— Plot normalized CCI cci = ta.cci(close, 20) plot(normalize(cci, 100, 300), "Normalized CCI", #2962FF) // Arbitrary and inexact equivalent of 100 and -100 levels rescaled to the 100/300 scale. band00 = hline(150, "Lower Band", color.new(#C0C0C0, 90), hline.style\_solid) band01 = hline(250, "Upper Band", color.new(#C0C0C0, 90), hline.style\_solid) fill(band01, band00, color.new(#21328F, 80), "Background") // ————— Plot normalized volume in the same region as the rescaled RSI color volColor = close > open ? #26a69a : #ef5350 plot(normalize(volume, -100, 100), "Normalized volume", volColor, style = plot.style\_columns, histbase = -100) hline(100, "", color.new(color.gray, 50), hline.style\_dashed) hline(-100, "", color.new(color.gray, 50), hline.style\_solid) // ————— Plot rescaled RSI plot(rescale(ta.rsi(close, 14), 0, 100, -100, 100), "Rescaled RSI", #8E1599) hline(0, "RSI 50 level", color.new(color.gray, 70), hline.style\_solid) // Precise equivalent of 70 and 30 levels rescaled to the -100/100 scale. band10 = hline(-40, "Lower Band", color.new(#9915FF, 80), hline.style\_solid) band11 = hline(40, "Upper Band", color.new(#9915FF, 80), hline.style\_solid) fill(band11, band10, color.new(#9915FF, 90), "Background") // ————— Plot original values in Data Window plot(na, "═══════════════", display = display.data\_window) plot(cci, "Original CCI", display = display.data\_window) plot(volume, "Original volume", display = display.data\_window) plot(ta.rsi(close, 14), "Original RSI", display = display.data\_window)

## [How can I calculate my script’s run time?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#how-can-i-calculate-my-scripts-run-time)

Programmers can measure the time that a script takes to run and see detailed information about which parts of the code take longest in the Pine Profiler. See the section of the User Manual on [Profiling and optimization](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/writing/profiling-and-optimization/) for more information.

## [How can I save a value when an event occurs?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#how-can-i-save-a-value-when-an-event-occurs)

To save a value when an event occurs, use a _persistent variable_. Scripts declare persistent variables by using the [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/variable-declarations/#var) keyword. Such variables are initialized only once, at [bar\_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index) zero, instead of on each bar, and maintain the same value after that unless changed.

In the following example script, the [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/variable-declarations/#var) keyword allows the `priceAtCross` variable to maintain its value between bars until a crossover event occurs, when the script updates the variable with the current close price. The [:=](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/operators/#-reassignment-operator) reassignment operator ensures that the global variable `priceAtCross` is modified. Using the [\=](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/operators/#-assignment-operator) assignment operator instead would create a new local variable that is inaccessible outside the [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/conditional-structures/#if-structure) block. The new local variable would have the same name as the global variable, which is called _shadowing_. The compiler warns about shadow variables.

//@version=6 indicator("Save a value when an event occurs", "", true) float hiHi = ta.highest(high, 5)\[1\] var float priceAtCross = na if ta.crossover(close, hiHi) // When a crossover occurs, assign the current close price to \`priceAtCross\`. priceAtCross := close plot(hiHi) plot(priceAtCross, "Price At Cross", color.orange, 3, plot.style\_circles)

## [How can I count touches of a specific level?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#how-can-i-count-touches-of-a-specific-level)

The most efficient way to count touches of a specific level is by tracking the series on each bar. A robust approach requires maintaining separate tallies for up and down bar touches and taking into account any gaps across the level. Using loops instead would be inefficient and impractical in this case.

The following example script records a value of 1 in a series whenever a touch occurs, and uses the [math.sum()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_math.sum) function to count these instances within the last `touchesLengthInput` bars. This script displays the median and touches on the chart using the `force_overlay` parameter of the `plot*()` functions, and displays the count in a separate pane.

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Techniques-How-can-i-count-touches-of-a-specific-level-1.zhHd3SG6_z6sBN.webp)

//@version=6 indicator("Median Touches", "", overlay = false) int medianLengthInput = input.int(100, "Median calculation: Number of previous closes") int touchesLengthInput = input.int(50, "Number of previous bars to check for price touches") float median = ta.percentile\_nearest\_rank(close, medianLengthInput, 50) // Don"t count neutral touches when price doesn't move. bool barUp = close > open bool barDn = close < open // Bar touches median. bool medianTouch = high > median and low < median bool gapOverMedian = high\[1\] < median and low > median bool gapUnderMedian = low\[1\] > median and high < median // Record touches. int medianTouchUp = medianTouch and barUp or gapOverMedian ? 1 : 0 int medianTouchDn = medianTouch and barDn or gapUnderMedian ? 1 : 0 // Count touches over the last n bars. float touchesUp = math.sum(medianTouchUp, touchesLengthInput) float touchesDn = math.sum(medianTouchDn, touchesLengthInput) // —————————— Plots // Markers plotchar(medianTouchUp, "medianTouchUp", "▲", location.belowbar, color.lime, force\_overlay = true) plotchar(medianTouchDn, "medianTouchDn", "▼", location.abovebar, color.red, force\_overlay = true) // Median plot(median, "Median", color.orange, force\_overlay = true) // Base areas. plot( touchesUp, "Touches Up", color.green, style = plot.style\_columns) plot(-touchesDn, "Touches Dn", color.maroon, style = plot.style\_columns) // Exceeding area. float minTouches = math.min(touchesUp, touchesDn) bool minTouchesIsUp = touchesUp < touchesDn basePlus = plot(minTouches, "Base Plus", display = display.none) hiPlus = plot(not minTouchesIsUp ? touchesUp : na, "High Plus", display = display.none) baseMinus = plot(-minTouches, "Base Plus", display = display.none) loMinus = plot(minTouchesIsUp ? -touchesDn : na, "Low Minus", display = display.none) fill(basePlus, hiPlus, color.lime) fill(baseMinus, loMinus, color.red)

## [How can I know if something is happening for the first time since the beginning of the day?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#how-can-i-know-if-something-is-happening-for-the-first-time-since-the-beginning-of-the-day)

One way is to use the [ta.barssince()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.barssince) function to check if the number of bars since the last occurrence of a condition, plus one, is greater than the number of bars since the beginning of the new day.

Another method is to use a _persistent state_ to decide whether an _event_ can happen. When the timeframe changes to a new day, the state is reset to allow the event. If the condition occurs while the state allows it, an event triggers. When the event triggers, the state is set so so as not to allow the event.

The following example script shows both methods.

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Techniques-How-can-know-if-something-is-happening-for-the-first-time-since-the-beginning-of-the-day-1.CvNLhI4e_Z3pwv0.webp)

## [How can I optimize Pine Script™ code?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#how-can-i-optimize-pine-script-code)

Optimizing Pine Script™ code can make scripts run faster and use less memory. For large or complex scripts, optimization can avoid scripts reaching the [computational limits](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/writing/limitations/).

The [Pine Profiler](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/writing/profiling-and-optimization/) analyzes all significant code in a script and displays how long each line or block takes to run. Before optimizing code, run the Pine Profiler to identify which parts of the code to optimize first. The Pine Profiler section of the User Guide contains an extensive discussion of [how to optimize code](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/writing/profiling-and-optimization/#optimization). In addition, consider the following tips:

-   Use strategy scripts only to model trades. Otherwise, use indicator scripts, which are faster.
-   Become familiar with the Pine [execution model](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/execution-model/) and [time series](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/time-series/) to structure code effectively.
-   Declare variables with the [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/variable-declarations/#var) keyword when initialization involves time-consuming operations like complex functions, arrays, objects, or string manipulations.
-   Keep operations on strings to a necessary minimum, because they can be more resource-intensive than operations on other types.
-   Using built-in functions is usually faster than writing custom functions that do the same thing. Sometimes, alternative logic can be more efficient than usng standard functions. For example, use a persistent variable when an event occurs, to avoid using [ta.valuewhen()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.valuewhen), as described in the FAQ entry [How can I save a value when an event occurs?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#how-can-i-save-a-value-when-an-event-occurs). Or save the [bar\_index](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_bar_index) when a condition occurs to avoid using [ta.barssince()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.barssince), as described in the FAQ entry [How to remember the last time a condition occurred?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#how-to-remember-the-last-time-a-condition-occurred).

## [How can I access a stock’s financial information?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#how-can-i-access-a-stocks-financial-information)

In Pine, the [request.financial()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.financial) function can directly request financial data.

On the chart, users can open financial indicators in the “Financials” section of the “Indicators, Metrics & Strategies” window.

## [How can I find the maximum value in a set of events?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#how-can-i-find-the-maximum-value-in-a-set-of-events)

Finding the maximum value of a variable that has a meaningful value _on every bar_, such as the [high](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_high) or [low](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_low) in price, is simple, using the [ta.highest()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.highest) function.

However, if the values do not occur on every bar, we must instead store each value when it occurs and then find the maximum. The most flexible way to do this is by using an [array](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/arrays/).

The following example script stores pivot highs in a fixed-length array. The array is managed as a [queue](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/arrays/#using-an-array-as-a-queue): the script adds new pivots to the end, and removes the oldest element from the array. To identify the highest value among the stored pivots, we use the [array.max()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_array.max) function and plot this maximum value on the chart. Additionally, we place markers on the chart to indicate when the pivots are detected, and the bars where the pivots occurred. By definition, these points are not the same, because a pivot is only confirmed after a certain number of bars have elapsed.

//@version=6 indicator("Max pivot demo", "", true) // Create inputs to specify the pivot legs and the number of last pivots to keep to compare. int pivotLengthInput = input.int(5, "Pivot length", minval = 1) int numPivotsInput = input.int(3, "Number of pivots to check") // Initialize an array with a size based on the number of recent pivots to evaluate. var array<float> pivotsArray = array.new<float>(numPivotsInput) // Find the pivot value and set up a condition to verify if a value has been found. float ph = ta.pivothigh(pivotLengthInput, pivotLengthInput) bool newPH = not na(ph) // When a new pivot is found, add it to the array and discard the oldest value. if newPH pivotsArray.push(ph) pivotsArray.shift() // Display the max value from the array on the chart, along with markers indicating the positions and detection times of the pivot highs. plot(pivotsArray.max()) plotchar(newPH, "newPH", "•", location.abovebar, offset = - pivotLengthInput) plotchar(newPH, "newPH", "▲", location.top)

## [How can I display plot values in the chart’s scale?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#how-can-i-display-plot-values-in-the-charts-scale)

To display the names and values of plots from an indicator in the chart’s scale, right-click on the chart to open the chart “Settings” menu. In the “Scales and lines” tab, select “Name” and “Value” from the “Indicators and financials” drop-down menu.

## [How can I reset a sum on a condition?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#how-can-i-reset-a-sum-on-a-condition)

To sum a series of values, initialize a persistent variable by using the [var](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/variable-declarations/#var) keyword to the track the sum. Then use a logical test to reset the values when a condition occurs.

In the following example script, we initialize a persistent variable called `cumulativeVolume` to track the sum of the [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume). Then we reset it to zero on a Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) cross up or down.

We plot the cumulative [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume) on the chart, as well as arrows to show the MACD crosses.

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Techniques-How-can-i-reset-a-sum-on-a-condition-1.-sS8zw0l_miQ2Y.webp)

//@version=6 indicator("Reset sum on condition example", overlay = false) const color TEAL = color.new(color.teal, 50) const color RED = color.new(color.red, 50) \[macdLine, signalLine, \_\] = ta.macd(close, 12, 26, 9) bool crossUp = ta.crossover(macdLine, signalLine) bool crossDn = ta.crossunder(macdLine, signalLine) bool doReset = crossUp or crossDn var float cumulativeVolume = na cumulativeVolume += volume // On every bar, we sum the volume. cumulativeVolume := doReset ? 0. : cumulativeVolume // But when we get a cross, we reset it to zero. plot(cumulativeVolume, "Cumulative volume", close >= open ? TEAL : RED, 1, plot.style\_columns) plotshape(crossUp, "crossDn", shape.arrowup, location.top, color.lime) plotshape(crossDn, "crossUp", shape.arrowdown, location.top, color.fuchsia)

Note that:

-   In the [ta.macd()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.macd) function call, we only require two of the three values returned in the [tuple](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#tuples). To avoid unnecessary variable declarations, we assign the third tuple value to an underscore. Here, [the underscore acts like a dummy variable](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/variable-declarations/#using-an-underscore-_-as-an-identifier).

## [How can I accumulate a value for two exclusive states?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#how-can-i-accumulate-a-value-for-two-exclusive-states)

Consider a simple indicator defined by two exclusive states: _buy_ and _sell_. The indicator cannot be in both _buy_ and _sell_ states simultaneously. In the _buy_ state, the script accumulates the [volume](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_volume) of shares being traded. In the _sell_ state, the accumulation of volume begins again from zero.

There are different ways to code this kind of logic. See the FAQ entry [“How can I alternate conditions”](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#how-can-i-alternate-conditions) for an example of using an [enum](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/enums/#enums) to manage two exclusive states. The following example script uses two boolean variables to do the same thing.

Additionally, this script demonstrates the concept of _events_ and _states_. An event is a condition that occurs on one or more arbitrary bars. A state is a condition that persists over time. Typically, programmers use events to turn states on and off. In turn, states can allow or prevent other processing.

The script plots arrows for events, which are based on rising or falling values of the [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) price. These events determine which of the two exclusive states is active; the script colors the background according to the current state. The script accumulates bullish and bearish volume only in the corresponding bullish or bearish state, displaying it in a Weis Wave fashion.

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Techniques-How-can-i-accumulate-a-value-for-two-exclusive-states-1.6ND5oJEJ_Z1ataMH.webp)

//@version=6 indicator("Cumulative volume", "") bool upEvent = ta.rising(close, 2) bool dnEvent = ta.falling(close, 2) var bool upState = false, var bool dnState = false // When the right event occurs, turn the state on; when a counter-event occurs, turn it off; otherwise, persist it. upState := upEvent ? true : dnEvent ? false : upState dnState := upEvent ? false : dnEvent ? true : dnState var float volUp = na, var float volDn = na if upState // For every bar that we are in the up state, volUp += volume // sum the up volume. if dnState volDn += volume if upEvent // If we change state to up, volDn := 0 // reset the down volume. if dnEvent volUp := 0 plot(+volUp, "Up Volume", color.green, 4, plot.style\_columns) plot(-volDn, "Dn Volume", color.maroon, 4, plot.style\_columns) plotchar(upEvent, "Up Event", "▲", location.bottom, color.green, size = size.tiny) plotchar(dnEvent, "Dn Event", "▼", location.top, color.maroon, size = size.tiny) bgcolor(upState ? color.new(color.green, 90) : dnState ? color.new(color.red, 90) : na)

Note that:

-   Equivalent logic using ternary conditions is smaller and potentially more efficient, but not as easy to read, extend, or debug. This more verbose logic illustrates the concepts of events and states, which can apply to many types of scripting problems. This logic is an extension of the on-off switch in the FAQ entry [“How can I implement an on/off switch?“](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#how-can-i-implement-an-onoff-switch).
-   When using states, it is important to make the conditions for resetting states explicit, to avoid unforeseen problems.
-   Displaying all events and states during script development, either on the chart or in the Data Window, helps debugging.

## [How can I organize my script’s inputs in the Settings/Inputs tab?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/techniques/#how-can-i-organize-my-scripts-inputs-in-the-settingsinputs-tab)

A script’s plots and inputs constitute its user interface. The following example script uses the following techniques to organize inputs for greater clarity:

-   **Grouping inputs:** Create a section header for a group of inputs by using the `group` parameter in the [input()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input) functions. Use constants for group names to simplify any potential name changes.
-   **Visual boundaries:** Use ASCII characters to create separators, establishing visual boundaries for distinct group sections. For continuous separator lines, reference group headers 1 and 2 in our script below, which use ASCII characters 205 or 196. Conversely, the dash (ASCII 45) and Em dash (ASCII 151), shown in group headers 3 and 4, do not join continuously, resulting in a less visually appealing distinction. Note that Unicode characters might display differently across different machines and browsers, potentially altering their appearance or spacing for various users.
-   **Indentation of sub-sections:** For a hierarchical representation, use Unicode whitespace characters to indent input sub-sections. Group 3 in our script uses the Em space ( ) 8195 (0x2003) to give a tab-like spacing.
-   **Vertical alignment of inlined inputs:** In our script, Group 1 shows how vertical alignment is difficult when inline inputs have varied `title` lengths. To counteract this misalignment, Group 2 uses the Unicode EN space ( ): 8194 (0x2002) for padding, since regular spaces are stripped from the label. For precise alignment, use different quantities and types of Unicode spaces. See [here](https://jkorpela.fi/chars/spaces.html) for a list of Unicode spaces of different widths. Note that, much like the separator characters, the rendering of these spaces might differ across browsers and machines.
-   **Placing inputs on one line:** Add multiple related inputs into a single line using the `inline` parameter. Group 4 in our script adds the title argument to just the first input and skips it for the others.

Tips:

-   Order the inputs to prioritize user convenience rather than to reflect the order used in the script’s calculations.
-   Never use two checkboxes for mutually exclusive selections. Use dropdown menus instead.
-   Remember that dropdown menus can accommodate long strings.
-   Provide adequate minimum and maximum values for numeric values, selecting the proper [float](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_float) or [int](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#type_int) type.
-   Customize step values based on the specific needs of each input.
-   Because checkboxes cannot be indented, use the [input()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_input) function’s `options` parameter to create dropdown selections so that the sections appear more organized compared to using checkboxes.
-   Observe how the `level3Input` is calculated as a boolean variable by comparing the input with the `EQ1` “ON” constant. This method provides a visually appealing indented on-off switch in the menu without adding complexity to the code.
-   For a consistent visual appearance, vertically center the separator titles across all inputs. Due to the proportional spacing of the font, achieving this might require some trial and error.
-   To ensure that separators align just slightly to the left of the furthest edge of dropdowns, begin with the longest input title, because it sets the width of the window.
-   To avoid adjusting separators if the longest input title is shorter than initially anticipated, extend its length using Unicode white space. Refer to the code example for input `level4Input` for a demonstration.

## [How do I make an alert available from my script?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/alerts/#how-do-i-make-an-alert-available-from-my-script)

In indicator scripts, there are two ways to define triggers for [alerts](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/alerts/):

-   Using the [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) function
-   Using the [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) function

In strategy scripts, there are also two ways to define alert triggers:

-   Using the [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) function
-   Using [order fill events](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/alerts/#order-fill-events)

These methods make alert triggers available but do not _create_ alerts directly. Users must create alerts using a script’s alert triggers by selecting the appropriate trigger in the “Condition” dropdown of the “Create Alert” dialog box.

Programmers can define multiple alert triggers of one or more types in a script.

## [How are the types of alerts different?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/alerts/#how-are-the-types-of-alerts-different)

### [Usability](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/alerts/#usability)

Any script can include calls to the [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) and [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) functions within their code. However, [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) calls have no effect unless the script is an _indicator_. [Libraries](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/libraries) can _export_ functions containing [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) calls, but they cannot issue alert triggers directly.

[Order fill](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/alerts/#order-fill-events) alert triggers are available only from [strategies](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/strategies/).

### [Options for creating alerts](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/alerts/#options-for-creating-alerts)

Each [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) call in an indicator script defines one distinct trigger and one corresponding option in the “Condition” dropdown menu of the “Create Alert” dialog box. If the user wants multiple alerts, they must create each one _separately_.

By contrast, if a script includes one or more [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) function calls, only _one_ option appears in the “Condition” dropdown menu, titled “Any alert() function call”. Selecting this option creates a _single alert_ that activates based on the occurrences of _any_ executed [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) call.

Similarly, for strategy scripts, the “Order fills and and alert() function calls” or “Order fills only” option in the “Condition” dropdown menu creates an alert that fires when _any_ [order fill event](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/alerts/#order-fill-events) occurs.

### [How alerts activate](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/alerts/#how-alerts-activate)

The [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) function operates exclusively in an indicator’s [global scope](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/programming/#what-does-scope-mean). Scripts cannot include calls to this function within any _local block_, such as the _indented_ code within an [if](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_if) structure. The function triggers an alert when its specified `condition` is `true`. Users can set the allowed _frequency_ of the alert trigger using the “Frequency” field in the “Create Alert” dialog box.

The [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) function has no `condition` parameter. Scripts trigger the alerts on any [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) call based on each call’s `freq` argument. Therefore, programmers typically include such calls within the local scopes of [conditional structures](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/conditional-structures) to control when they execute.

Order fill alert triggers are available from [strategies](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/strategies/) _automatically_ without requiring extra code. However, programmers can customize the default alert messages. These alerts fire on [order fill events](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/alerts/#order-fill-events), which occur when the [broker emulator](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/strategies/#broker-emulator) fills a strategy’s _orders_.

### [Messages](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/alerts/#messages)

The `message` parameter of the [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) function populates the “Message” field of the “Create Alert” dialog box with a default message, which script users can customize to suit their alert needs. It accepts a “const string” argument, meaning its value cannot change after compilation. However, the argument can include [placeholders](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000531021-how-to-use-a-variable-value-in-alert/) to make the message’s information _dynamic_.

The `message` parameter of the [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) function accepts a “series string” argument, allowing programmers to create _dynamic messages_ that can include “string” representations of a script’s calculated values. Unlike [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition), this function does not populate a “Message” field in the “Create Alert” dialog box, and it does not process placeholders. Programmers can allow users to customize [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) messages by creating [inputs](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/inputs) in the script’s settings.

Order fill alerts have a default message that describes a strategy’s order fill event. This default message contains strategy-specific [placeholders](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000531021-how-to-use-a-variable-value-in-alert/), which the alert replaces with current strategy information each time it fires. Programmers can override the default message using the `//@strategy_alert_message` [compiler annotation](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/script-structure/#compiler-annotations), which allows text and strategy placeholders, but _not_ script variables. Script users can edit the default message from the “Message” field in the “Create Alert” dialog.

The `alert_message` parameter in a strategy’s [order placement commands](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/strategies/#order-placement-and-cancellation) allows programmers to define distinct messages for each order fill event. The parameter accepts “series string” values that can change on each event. To use the values from this parameter in a strategy’s order fill alerts, include the `{{strategy.order.alert_message}}` placeholder in the `//@strategy_alert_message` annotation, or include it in the “Message” field when creating an alert.

### [Limitations](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/alerts/#limitations)

The [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) function has some limitations:

-   Each active alert condition counts toward the total number of alerts the user’s [plan](https://www.tradingview.com/pricing/) allows.
-   Every [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) call contributes to the script’s [plot count](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/writing/limitations/#plot-limits).
-   Only indicators can issue alert triggers with this function. Other script types do not raise a compilation error when they include calls to this function in their code, but each call has **no effect**.

By contrast, all calls to the [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) function count as **one** alert, regardless of the number of calls in the code. In addition, [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) calls _do not_ contribute to a script’s plot count.

Similarly, if a user creates a strategy alert based on [order fill events](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/alerts/#order-fill-events), it counts as **one** alert, even though it can fire multiple times with distinct messages from different order executions.

### [Example \`alertcondition()\` alert](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/alerts/#example-alertcondition-alert)

The script below demonstrates a simple [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) call that triggers alerts when the current bar’s [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) is above the value from the previous chart bar. It also uses a [plotshape()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_plotshape) call to indicate each bar where the `triggerCondition` occurred:

//@version=6 indicator("Simple alert demo", overlay = true) // Create condition to trigger alert. bool triggerCondition = close > close\[1\] // Use \`triggerCondition\` for the \`condition\` parameter. // Define a title for the alert in the menu and a message to send with the alert. alertcondition(condition = triggerCondition, title = "Example \`alertcondition\` Alert", message = "The example \`alertcondition\` alert was triggered.") // Plot a shape when \`triggerCondition\` is true to visually mark where alerts occur. plotshape(triggerCondition, "Trigger Condition", shape.xcross, color = color.fuchsia)

See [this section](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/alerts/#alertcondition-events) of the [Alerts](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/alerts/) page to learn more.

### [Example \`alert()\` alert](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/alerts/#example-alert-alert)

This example uses the `vstop()` function from our [ta](https://www.tradingview.com/script/BICzyhq0-ta/) library to calculate a volatility stop value and trend information based on the Average True Range ([ATR](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000501823-average-true-range-atr/)). The `stopValue` trails behind the chart’s [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) to form a trend-following system.

The script triggers an alert with an [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) call each time the trend direction changes. The alert’s message is a “series string” that shows the trend’s new direction and the current stop value. An additional alert occurs whenever the `stopValue` moves in the current trend direction, with a message containing the updated value:

//@version=6 indicator("Vstop alert demo", overlay = true) import TradingView/ta/7 as TVta // Calculate ATR trailing stop and determine trend direction. \[stopValue, trendUp\] = TVta.vStop(close, 20, 2) // Round the stop value to mintick for accuracy in comparison operators. float stop = math.round\_to\_mintick(stopValue) // Check for trend changes. bool trendReversal = trendUp != trendUp\[1\] bool trendToDn = trendReversal and not trendUp bool trendToUp = trendReversal and trendUp // Create color variables for the plot display. color plotColor = trendUp ? color.green : color.red color lineColor = trendReversal ? color(na) : plotColor // Plot the stop value on the chart. Plot a circle on trend changes. plot(stop, "V-Stop", lineColor) plot(trendReversal ? stop : na, "Trend Change Circle", plotColor, 3, plot.style\_circles) // Convert the stop value to string for use in the alert messages. string stopStr = str.tostring(stop) // If the trend changed to up, send a long alert with the initial stop value. if trendToUp alert("Long alert. Stop @ " + stopStr, alert.freq\_once\_per\_bar\_close) // If the trend changed to down, send a short alert with the initial stop value. if trendToDn alert("Short alert. Stop @ " + stopStr, alert.freq\_once\_per\_bar\_close) // If the stop value has progressed, send an alert to update the stop value. if (trendUp and stop > stop\[1\] or not trendUp and stop < stop\[1\]) and not trendReversal alert('Update stop to ' + stopStr, alert.freq\_once\_per\_bar\_close)

See [this section](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/alerts/#script-alerts) of the [Alerts](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/alerts/) page for more information.

### [Example strategy alert](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/alerts/#example-strategy-alert)

This example strategy places a [market order](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/strategies/#market-orders) with [strategy.entry()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.entry) and a stop-loss and take-profit (bracket) order with [strategy.exit()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_strategy.exit) when a 5-bar moving average crosses over a 10-bar moving average. The stop-loss price is 1% below the current [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) and the take-profit price is 2% above the [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close). Order fill alerts occur when the broker emulator fills an entry or exit order. Both [order placement commands](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/strategies/#order-placement-and-cancellation) include unique `alert_message` arguments that combine placeholders and “string” representations of the `limit` and `stop` values to output details like the trade action, position size, chart symbol, and order prices:

//@version=6 // This annotation auto-populates the alert dialogue with the \`alert\_message\` string. // @strategy\_alert\_message {{strategy.order.alert\_message}} strategy("Alert message demo", overlay = true) // Declare two moving averages to use for the entry condition. float fastMa = ta.sma(close, 5) float slowMa = ta.sma(close, 10) // Declare two persistent variables that will hold our stop-loss and take-profit values. var float limit = na var float stop = na // If \`fastMa\` has crossed over \`slowMa\` and we are not already in a position, // place an entry and exit order. // • Set the \`limit\` to 2% above the close and the stop to 1% below. // • Use a combination of script variables and placeholders in the alert strings. // • The exit alert shows the order direction, position size, ticker, and order price. // • The entry alert includes the same values plus the stop and limit price. if ta.crossover(fastMa, slowMa) and strategy.position\_size == 0 limit := close \* 1.02 stop := close \* 0.99 string exitString = "{{strategy.order.action}} {{strategy.position\_size}} {{ticker}} @ {{strategy.order.price}}" string entryString = exitString + " TP: " + str.tostring(limit, format.mintick) + " SL: " + str.tostring(stop, format.mintick) strategy.entry("Buy", strategy.long, alert\_message = entryString) strategy.exit("Exit", "Buy", stop = stop, limit = limit, alert\_message = exitString) // Plot the moving averages, stop, and limit values on the chart. plot(fastMa, "Fast Moving Average", color.aqua) plot(slowMa, "Slow Moving Average", color.orange) plot(strategy.position\_size > 0 ? limit : na, "Limit", color.green, style = plot.style\_linebr) plot(strategy.position\_size > 0 ? stop : na, "Stop", color.red, style = plot.style\_linebr)

For more information about order fill events, see [this section](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/alerts/#order-fill-events) of the [Alerts](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/alerts/) page. To learn more about how strategy scripts work, see the [Strategies](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/strategies/) page.

## [If I change my script, does my alert change?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/alerts/#if-i-change-my-script-does-my-alert-change)

No, not without creating a new alert.

When a user creates an alert using the “Create Alert” dialog box, that action saves a “snapshot” of the script, its inputs, and the current chart’s context on TradingView’s servers. This snapshot acts as an independent _copy_ of the script instance and chart. Therefore, any changes to the script, its inputs, or the user’s chart **do not** affect that created alert. To update an alert after making changes, _delete_ the existing alert and _create_ a new one.

## [Why aren’t my alerts working?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/alerts/#why-arent-my-alerts-working)

Here are some common reasons why alerts might not work as expected, and how to solve them:

**Make sure the alert is active and has not expired**

Scripts that include alert triggers **do not** directly create alerts. Users must create alerts in the “Create Alert” dialog box, where they specify the “Condition” that triggers the alert and the “Expiration” time. Created alerts do not fire after they expire. See this Help Center article on [Setting up alerts](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000595315-how-to-set-up-alerts/).

**Check the alert logs**

An alert can fire without a notification, depending on the alert’s settings. Check the logs in the [alert manager](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000595311-manage-alerts/) to see whether an alert occurred. To set up notifications for an alert, use the options in the “Notifications” tab of the “Create/Edit Alert” dialog box.

**Check for repainting**

If an alert fires at a different time than expected, _repainting_ might be the cause. Refer to the [Repainting](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/repainting/) page for more information.

**Limit the frequency of alerts**

If more than 15 alerts occur within three minutes, the system automatically _halts_ further alerts. This [frequency limit](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000690939-alert-was-triggered-too-often-and-stopped/) helps prevent excessive notifications and potential server overload.

**Debug script errors**

If a script instance raises a _runtime error_ at some point during its executions, alerts from that instance **cannot** fire because the error stops the script from continuing to execute its code. Some common issues that can halt alerts include:

-   Attempting to store more than 100,000 elements within a [collection](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/type-system/#collections)
-   Trying to access an item from a collection at an _out-of-bounds_ index
-   Referencing historical values of a time series outside its allocated [memory buffer](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/error-messages/#pine-script-cannot-determine-the-referencing-length-of-a-series-try-using-max_bars_back-in-the-indicator-or-strategy-function)
-   Using [loops](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/loops/) that take longer than 500 ms to complete their iterations

See [this page](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/error-messages/) for additional details about common error messages and troubleshooting tips.

## [Why is my alert firing at the wrong time?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/alerts/#why-is-my-alert-firing-at-the-wrong-time)

Sometimes, alerts may fire when users do not expect according to what their script displays on the chart. [Repainting](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/repainting/) is the typical cause of such issues.

A chart’s realtime and historical bars often rely on _different_ [data feeds](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/other-timeframes-and-data/#data-feeds). Data providers may retroactively adjust the reported values on realtime bars, which the displayed data reflects _after_ users refresh their charts or restart their scripts. Such adjustments can cause discrepancies where a triggered alert’s timing may not align with the script’s output after reloading it.

Scripts may also behave differently on historical and realtime bars, which can lead to repainting. On historical bars, scripts execute once per bar close, whereas on realtime bars, where alerts fire, scripts execute once for _each new tick_ from the data feed. Therefore, if a script behaves differently on those bars, users may see differences between its signals and triggered alerts after reloading the chart.

Below are some common repainting issues that can affect a script’s alerts:

**Alerts firing before bar close**

Most scripts have [fluid data values](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/repainting/#fluid-data-values) that update after new ticks during an unconfirmed realtime bar and finalize after the bar closes. Consequently, an alert that fires on an open bar may not reflect the _final state_ of the condition after the bar’s confirmation. Set the alert’s frequency to “Once Per Bar Close” to avoid this issue.

**Using \`calc\_on\_every\_tick\` in strategies**

When a strategy script includes `calc_on_every_tick = true` in its declaration statement or the user selects the “On every tick” option in the “Recalculate” section of the strategy’s [properties](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000628599-strategy-properties/), it recalculates on _every_ price update in the realtime data. This behavior can cause strategies to repaint because historical bars do not contain the same information as realtime bars. See [this section](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/strategies/#altering-calculation-behavior) of the [Strategies](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/strategies/) page to learn more.

**Incorrect usage of \`request.security()\` calls**

Using [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) calls to fetch data from alternative timeframes can cause discrepancies on historical bars that scripts **cannot** reproduce on realtime bars. Ensure you follow the best practices for _non-repainting_ data requests to avoid such discrepancies, especially with higher-timeframe data. See the [Avoiding repainting](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/other-timeframes-and-data/#avoiding-repainting) section of the [Other timeframes and data](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/other-timeframes-and-data/) page and the [Higher-timeframe requests](https://www.tradingview.com/script/W1YpYcOI-Higher-timeframe-requests/) publication from PineCoders for more information.

## [Can I use variable messages with alertcondition()?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/alerts/#can-i-use-variable-messages-with-alertcondition)

The `message` parameter of the [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) function requires a “const string” argument, which **cannot change** after compilation. However, the “string” can include [placeholders](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/alerts/#placeholders), which an alert substitutes with corresponding dynamic values from a script each time it fires.

The script below demonstrates two [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) calls whose `message` arguments include placeholders for dynamic values. Each time alerts from these triggers occur, the message displays information about the current chart’s exchange, symbol, price, and volume:

//@version=6 indicator("Placeholder demo", overlay = false) \[macdLine, signalLine, histLine\] = ta.macd(close, 12, 26, 9) plot(macdLine, "MACD", color.blue) plot(signalLine, "Signal", color.orange) plot(histLine, "Hist.", color.red, style = plot.style\_histogram) bool crossUp = ta.crossover(macdLine, signalLine) bool crossDown = ta.crossunder(macdLine, signalLine) alertcondition(crossUp, "MACD Cross Up", "MACD cross up on {{exchange}}:{{ticker}}\\nprice = {{close}}\\nvolume = {{volume}}") alertcondition(crossDown, "MACD Cross Down", "MACD cross down on {{exchange}}:{{ticker}}\\nprice = {{close}}\\nvolume = {{volume}}")

## [How can I include values that change in my alerts?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/alerts/#how-can-i-include-values-that-change-in-my-alerts)

The method for including dynamic values in alert messages varies with the type of alert trigger:

-   The [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) function accepts a “const string” `message` argument that can contain placeholders for dynamic values. See [Can I use variable messages with \`alertcondition()\`?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/alerts/#can-i-use-variable-messages-with-alertcondition) for more information.
-   The [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) function accepts “series string” `message` arguments, which allows the convenient creation of dynamic messages that use a script’s calculated values. See [this section](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/alerts/#example-alert-alert) for an example.
-   Order fill alerts can use “series string” values and placeholders. Refer to the example [here](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/alerts/#example-strategy-alert).

## [How can I get custom alerts on many symbols?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/alerts/#how-can-i-get-custom-alerts-on-many-symbols)

To manage alerts across multiple symbols using a custom script, one option is to set an individual alert on each symbol. There is no automated method to set the same alert across many symbols simultaneously in a single action. It’s also important to note that the TradingView [screener](https://www.tradingview.com/screener/) uses built-in filters and does not support custom Pine Script™ code.

Scripts can retrieve data from other _contexts_ (symbols, timeframes, and modifiers such as non-standard chart calculations and extended sessions) using the functions in the `request.*()` namespace. With these functions, programmers can design scripts that retrieve data from up to 40 unique contexts. Search for “[screener](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/search/screener/)” in the Community scripts for in-depth examples.

Here is an example incorporating three symbols. The `checkForAlert()` function calls [request.security()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_request.security) to fetch data from a specified context and evaluate the user-defined `checkForRsiConditions()` function using that data. Then, the function calls [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) using the result to create an alert trigger. The script calls this function three times, creating distinct alert triggers for each specified symbol:

//@version=6 indicator("Screener demo", overlay = true) // Declare inputs for the alert symbols and the timeframe to run the alerts on. The default is the current chart timeframe. string tfInput = input.timeframe("", "Timeframe") string symbol1Input = input.symbol("BINANCE:ETHUSDT", "Symbol 1") string symbol2Input = input.symbol("BINANCE:BATUSDT", "Symbol 2") string symbol3Input = input.symbol("BINANCE:SOLUSDT", "Symbol 3") // @function Generates alert messages for RSI crossing over or under 50, and crosses of price and the 50 EMA. // @returns (string) Formatted alert messages with values for each crossover and crossunder event. checkForRsiConditions() => float rsi = ta.rsi(close, 14) float ema = ta.ema(close, 50) string alertMessage = "" if ta.crossover(rsi, 50) alertMessage += str.format("RSI ({0}) crossed over 50 for {1} on {2} timeframe.\\n", rsi, syminfo.ticker, timeframe.period) if ta.crossunder(rsi, 50) alertMessage += str.format("RSI ({0}) crossed under 50 for {1} on {2} timeframe.\\n", rsi, syminfo.ticker, timeframe.period) if ta.crossover(close, ema) alertMessage += str.format("Crossover of 50 EMA for {0} on {1} timeframe. Price is {2}", syminfo.ticker, timeframe.period, close) if ta.crossunder(close, ema) alertMessage += str.format("Crossunder of 50 EMA for {0} on {1} timeframe. Price is {2}", syminfo.ticker, timeframe.period, close) // @function Calls the \`checkForRsiConditions()\` function for the provided symbol and timeframe. // Triggers an alert if the function returns a message. // @param symbol (simple string) The symbol to check. // @param tf (simple string) The timeframe to check. // @param freq (const string) The frequency of the alert. Optional. Default is \`alert.freq\_once\_per\_bar\`. // @returns (void) The function has no explicit return, but triggers an alert with the message if the // conditions defined within the \`checkForRsiConditions()\` function are met. checkForAlert(simple string symbol, simple string tf, const string freq = alert.freq\_once\_per\_bar) => string msg = request.security(symbol, tf, checkForRsiConditions()) if msg != msg\[1\] and str.length(msg) > 0 alert(msg, freq) // Check for alerts on the input symbols and timeframe. checkForAlert(symbol1Input, tfInput) checkForAlert(symbol2Input, tfInput) checkForAlert(symbol3Input, tfInput) // Continue with additional symbols up to a maximum of 40...

Note that:

-   A script can execute up to 40 _unique_ `request.*()` calls. A `request.*()` call is not unique if a script already calls the same function with the same arguments. See [this section](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/writing/limitations/#number-of-calls) of the [Limitations](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/writing/limitations/) page for more information.
-   This script uses the [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) function because [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) is not allowed within _local scopes_.

## [How can I trigger an alert for only the first instance of a condition?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/alerts/#how-can-i-trigger-an-alert-for-only-the-first-instance-of-a-condition)

Firing an alert only on its first occurrence can help avoid redundant notifications and isolate specific conditions or state changes, which is beneficial in several use cases. For instance, if a user relies on alerts to automate order placement, restricting redundant alerts to their first occurrence can help avoid accidentally placing excessive orders.

For alerts with [alertcondition()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alertcondition) triggers, setting them to fire once using the “Only Once” option in the “Create Alert” dialog box is not an optimal solution because it requires _manual_ reactivation each time an alert occurs. Alerts from the [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) function do not have an “Only Once” frequency option. The programmer must use conditional logic to ensure the call executes at the appropriate time.

There are two primary ways to code repeating alerts that fire on only the first instance of a condition:

**Using more strict criteria**

Rather than relying on a continuous condition like `close > ma`, which may remain `true` for multiple consecutive bars, try using a more strict condition like [ta.crossover(close, ma)](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_ta.crossover). For simple cases, this is the easiest method.

**Using state control**

More complex scenarios may require controlling and tracking _states_, which entails setting flags or specific values to signify certain conditions.

The example script below manages separate bullish and bearish states, and it colors the background to represent each state. When a bullish or bearish state first occurs, an [alert()](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#fun_alert) call executes and the script plots a triangle on the chart. It also plots smaller triangles to show where other signals occur within a state, which do not trigger additional alerts:

//@version=6 indicator("Single alert demo", overlay = true) // ————— Calculations: Determine highest/lowest values over last \`lengthInput\` bars. int lengthInput = input.int(20, "Length") float highest = ta.highest(lengthInput) float lowest = ta.lowest(lengthInput) // ————— Trigger conditions: Define bull and bear signals.

It's set only at the initial switch to the opposite condition. // This variable's state is retained from bar to bar because we use the \`var\` keyword to declare it. var bool isBull = false // ————— State transitions: Allow a switch from bull to bear or bear to bull; ignore repeated signals in current state. // Set the state change flags to true only on the first bar where a new signal appears. if bullSignal and not isBull isBull := true changeToBull := true else if bearSignal and isBull isBull := false changeToBear := true // Plot highest and lowest values. plot(highest, "Highest", color.new(color.green, 80), 2) plot(lowest, "Lowest", color.new(color.red, 80), 2) // Background color: Green for bull, none for bear. bgcolor(isBull ? color.new(color.green, 90) : na) // State change markers: Display "ALERT" text on bars where a state change occurs and an alert would trigger. plotchar(changeToBull, "Change to Bull state", "▲", location.belowbar, color.new(color.lime, 30), size = size.small, text = "BULL\\nALERT") plotchar(changeToBear, "Change to Bear state", "▼", location.abovebar, color.new(color.red, 30), size = size.small, text = "BEAR\\nALERT") // Signal markers: Display for repeated signals within the current state. // These signals would trigger redundant alerts if not for the state tracking flag preventing them. plotchar(bullSignal and not changeToBull, "Bull signal", "▲", location.belowbar, color.green, size = size.tiny) plotchar(bearSignal and not changeToBear, "Bear signal", "▼", location.abovebar, color.maroon, size = size.tiny) // Alerts: Trigger on state changes only. if changeToBull alert("Change to bull state") if changeToBear alert("Change to bear state")

## [How can I run my alert on a timer or delay?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/alerts/#how-can-i-run-my-alert-on-a-timer-or-delay)

It is possible to program logic to delay alert triggers so that they occur _after_ the initial condition. However, because Pine scripts execute on realtime bars only after new _price updates_, and an alert only fires when a script _executes_, it is difficult to predict the exact time of a delayed alert.

There are no price updates in a closed market, meaning an alert with a delay will not fire until the market opens again. Similarly, thinly traded securities may have very infrequent price updates in unpredictable intervals, which can cause a larger delay than intended.

The Pine script below implements a _time-delayed_ alert, which is subject to the limitations above. When the current [close](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#var_close) is higher than a moving average, a delay counter starts. After the delay passes, the alert fires once, and another alert _cannot_ fire until the timer resets. Users can specify whether the timer resets on each bar using the script’s `resetInput`:

![image](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/_astro/Alerts-How-can-i-run-my-alert-on-a-timer-or-delay-1.K7lVQTwy_Z1XdLyV.webp)

//@version=6 indicator("Delayed alert demo", overlay = true) import PineCoders/Time/4 as PCtime string TIME\_TT = "The delay's duration and units. This specifies the continuous duration for which the condition must be true before triggering the alert." string RESET\_TT = "When checked, the duration will reset every time a new realtime bar begins." enum TimeUnit seconds minutes hours int durationInput = input.int(20, "Condition must last", minval = 1, inline = "00") TimeUnit timeUnitInput = input.enum(TimeUnit.seconds, "", inline="00") bool resetInput = input.bool(false, "Reset timing on new bar", tooltip = RESET\_TT) int maLengthInput = input.int(9, "MA length") // Calculate and plot a SMA with \`maLengthInput\` length. float ma = ta.sma(close, maLengthInput), plot(ma, "MA") // Check whether the close is greater than the SMA. bool cond = close > ma // Time the duration for which the condition has been true. int secSince = PCtime.secondsSince(cond, resetInput and barstate.isnew) // Check if the duration is greater than the input timer. bool timeAlert = secSince > (PCtime.timeFrom("bar", durationInput, str.tostring(timeUnitInput)) - time) / 1000 // Format a time string for the timer label. string alertTime = str.format\_time(secSince \* 1000, "mm:ss") // Set the contents for the label depending on the stage of the alert timer. string alertString = switch timeAlert => "Timed Alert Triggered\\n\\n" + alertTime cond => "Condition Detected...\\n\\nTimer count\\n" + alertTime => "Waiting for condition..." // Display alert timer using a label. Declare a basic label once and update location, color, and text on the last bar for efficiency. if barstate.islast var label condTime = label.new(na, na, yloc = yloc.abovebar, style = label.style\_label\_lower\_left, textcolor = chart.fg\_color) label.set\_x(condTime, bar\_index) label.set\_text(condTime, alertString) label.set\_color(condTime, color.new(timeAlert ? color.green : cond ? color.orange : color.red, 50)) // Create a flag to ensure alert is triggered only once each time the delay timer is exceeded. varip bool isFirstOccurrence = true // Fire alert if timer is triggered. if timeAlert and isFirstOccurrence alert(str.format("{0} {1} Delayed Alert Triggered", durationInput, str.tostring(timeUnitInput)), alert.freq\_all) // Toggle the flag to \`false\` when alert triggers, and reset when the condition clears. isFirstOccurrence := not timeAlert

Note that:

-   The `secondsSince()` function from the PineCoders’ [time](https://www.tradingview.com/script/tyeeNU9I-Time/) library determines the duration, in seconds, for which a certain condition remains continuously `true`. The duration can be tracked within bars because it uses the [varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip) keyword.
-   The timing starts when the condition first becomes `true`. If the condition becomes `false` or an optional resetting condition occurs, the timer restarts. If “Reset timing on new bar” is enabled in the “Settings/Inputs” tab, the function restarts its timing at the start of a new bar.
-   A colored label shows what state the script is in:
    1.  **Red** - The condition has not occurred yet.
    2.  **Orange** - The condition occurred and the delay timer is active.
    3.  **Green** - The timer has surpassed the set duration, simulating a delayed alert.

This script relies on variables declared with the [varip](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-reference/v6/#kw_varip) keyword, which do not revert to their last committed states during realtime bar calculations. See [this section](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/variable-declarations/#varip) of the User Manual to learn more about using this keyword. To learn about how _rollback_ works, see the [Execution model](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/language/execution-model/) page.

## [How can I create JSON messages in my alerts?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/alerts/#how-can-i-create-json-messages-in-my-alerts)

Alerts can send messages containing JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) to [webhooks](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000529348-about-webhooks/). Pine Script™ does not include any built-in functions to produce JSON, but programmers can create JSON messages in Pine by constructing “string” representations.

When constructing JSON representations, ensure the keys and values intended as strings in the JSON-formatted text use _double quotes_, not single quotes.

The following example shows three ways to construct JSON strings in Pine Script™:

1.  **Static JSON Strings**
    
    Define separate alerts with predefined JSON-formatted strings. This method is the simplest.
    
2.  **Placeholders**
    
    Use [placeholders](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/alerts/#placeholders) in the alert message, such as `{{close}}` and `{{volume}}`, to add _dynamic_ values to the JSON. The alert instance replaces the placeholders with corresponding values when it fires. This method can create richer alerts, especially for [strategies](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/strategies/), which have [extra placeholders](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000481368-strategy-alerts/) for their calculated values. See [this section](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/alerts/#example-strategy-alert) above for an example.
    
3.  **Dynamic strings**
    
    Use the functions in the `str.*()` namespace and “string” concatenation to create dynamic JSON-formatted text. This method is the most customizable and advanced. Our script below shows a simple, straightforward example of this approach. When using dynamic string formatting to construct JSON strings, ensure the resulting JSON is _valid_ for all the combined values.
    

//@version=6 indicator("JSON example", overlay = true) // Define EMA cross conditions to trigger alerts, and plot the ema on the chart. float ema = ta.ema(close, 21) bool crossUp = ta.crossover(close, ema) bool crossDown = ta.crossunder(close, ema) plot(ta.ema(close, 21)) // ————— Method 1 - Separate alerts with static messages. string alertMessage1a = '{"method": 1, "action": "buy", "direction": "long", "text": "Price crossed above EMA"}' string alertMessage1b = '{"method": 1, "action": "sell", "direction": "short", "text": "Price crossed below EMA"}' alertcondition(crossUp, "Method 1 - Cross up", alertMessage1a) alertcondition(crossDown, "Method 1 - Cross down", alertMessage1b) // Rendered alert: // { // "method": 1, // "action": "buy", // "direction": "long", // "text": "Price crossed above EMA" // } // ————— Method 2 - Using placeholders for dynamic values. string alertMessage2 = '{"method": 2, "price": {{close}}, "volume": {{volume}}, "ema": {{plot\_0}}}' alertcondition(crossUp, "Method 2 - Cross Up", alertMessage2) // Rendered alert: // { // "method": 2, // "price": 2066.29, // "volume": 100.859, // "ema": 2066.286 // } // ————— Method 3 - String concatenation using dynamic values. string alertMessage3 = '{"method": 3, "price": ' + str.tostring(close) + ', "volume": ' + str.tostring(volume) + ', "ema": ' + str.tostring(ema) + '}' if crossUp alert(alertMessage3, alert.freq\_once\_per\_bar\_close) // Rendered alert: // { // "method": 3, // "price": 2052.27, // "volume": 107.683, // "ema": 2052.168 // }

Before using the JSON-formatted string in alerts for real-world applications, such as sending messages to place orders, _test_ and _validate_ the JSON message to ensure it works as intended:

-   Send alerts to an email address to see how the JSON message appears.
-   Copy the alert message from the email into an online JSON validation tool.
-   Use an API client application to check the server response to the request.

Refer to [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) to learn more about JSON format. To learn more about how alerts send information using webhooks, see the Help Center article on [webhooks](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000529348-about-webhooks/).

## [How can I send alerts to Discord?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/alerts/#how-can-i-send-alerts-to-discord)

Sending alerts from a Pine script to a Discord chat room is possible using [webhooks](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000529348-about-webhooks/).

The message for Discord communication requires [JSON format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON). The _minimum_ requirement for a valid message is `{"content": "Your message here"}`.

The script example below uses [placeholders](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/concepts/alerts/#placeholders) to dynamically populate alert messages with script values, including the new high or low price, and the chart’s symbol and timeframe:

//@version=6 indicator("Discord demo", overlay = true) // Calculate a Donchian channel using the TV ta library. import TradingView/ta/7 as TVta int lengthInput = input.int(10, "Channel length") \[highest, lowest, middle\] = TVta.donchian(lengthInput) // Create conditions checking for a new channel high or low. bool isNewHi = high > highest\[1\] bool isNewLo = low < lowest\[1\] // Plot the Donchian channel and fill between the midpoint and the upper and lower halves. hi = plot(highest, "Channel high", color.new(color.fuchsia, 70)) mid = plot(middle, "Channel mid.", color.new(color.gray, 70)) lo = plot(lowest, "Channel low", color.new(color.lime, 70)) fill(mid, hi, color.new(color.fuchsia, 95)) fill(mid, lo, color.new(color.lime, 95)) // Plot shapes to mark new highs and lows to visually identify where alert trigger conditions occur. plotshape(isNewHi, "isNewHi", shape.arrowup, location.abovebar, color.new(color.lime, 70)) plotshape(isNewLo, "isNewLo", shape.arrowdown, location.belowbar, color.new(color.fuchsia, 70)) // Create two alert conditions, one for new highs, and one for new lows. // Format the message for Discord in the following JSON format: {"content": "Your message here"} alertcondition(isNewHi, "New High (Discord Alert Demo)", '{"content": "New high ({{high}}) on {{ticker}} on {{interval}} chart!"}') alertcondition(isNewLo, "New Low (Discord Alert Demo)", '{"content": "New low ({{low}}) on {{ticker}} on {{interval}} chart!"}') // The following test alert condition fires immediately. Set this alert frequency to "Only Once". alertcondition(true, "Test (Discord Alert Demo)", '{"content": "This is a test alert from TradingView to Discord."}')

To send these alert messages to Discord, follow these steps:

**1\. Create a Discord webhook**

-   Create a new webhook in a server using an account with webhook creation and management permissions. Refer to Discord’s [Intro to Webhooks](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) article for instructions.
-   Copy the Webhook URL. This URL represents the address where the alert sends a POST request.

**2\. Set up an alert on TradingView**

-   Add the above “Discord demo” script to a chart and open the “Create Alert” dialog box.
-   Choose one of the script’s alert conditions as the “Condition” in the dialog. If you select the “New High” or “New Low” alerts, choose the “Once Per Bar Close” option in the “Frequency” field to avoid triggering alerts for new highs or lows on an unconfirmed bar. When using the “Test” alert, choose “Only Once” as the “Frequency” option.
-   In the “Notifications” tab of the “Create Alert” dialog, select “Webhook URL” and paste the URL of the Discord webhook.

**3\. Test the integration**

-   Check that alerts appear in the alert log on TradingView.
-   Use the “Test” alert to check whether the webhook works as expected. After the alert fires, check your Discord to see if it received the message.
-   If the alert message does not appear in Discord, check whether the pasted webhook URL is correct.
-   If the message does not display correctly in Discord, check the JSON format. The minimum required format is `{"content": "Your message here"}`.

Consult Discord’s [Webhook Resource](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook#webhook-resource) to learn about advanced JSON message configurations.

## [How can I send alerts to Telegram?](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/faq/alerts/#how-can-i-send-alerts-to-telegram)

Sending TradingView alerts directly to Telegram is challenging due to protocol differences and formatting requirements. One solution is to use an intermediary service, which receives webhook alerts from TradingView, formats them as required by Telegram, and then forwards them to a Telegram bot.

1.  Choose a platform like Zapier, Integromat, or Pipedream. Alternatively, programmers can consider developing a custom server script using Node.js or Python.
2.  In TradingView, set up alerts to send [webhook requests](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000529348-about-webhooks/) to the intermediary service’s provided URL.
3.  Configure the intermediary service to reformat TradingView’s incoming requests for Telegram’s API and send the formatted message to a Telegram bot using the `sendMessage` method.

See the Telegram Bot API [documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots) for detailed technical information.

This indicator calculates a fast MA and a slow MA. Their lengths can be changed in the indicator settings (the default is 9 and 18). When the fast MA crosses above the slow MA, the strategy enters a long. If the fast MA crosses below the slow MA, the strategy enters a short.

#### Summary

The defaults are 9 and 18, but they can be changed to the needs of the user. The strategy enters long when the fast moving average crosses about the slow moving average and it enters short when the fast moving average crosses below the slow moving average.

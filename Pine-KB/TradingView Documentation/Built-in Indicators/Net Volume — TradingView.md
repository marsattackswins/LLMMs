#### Definition

Net volume is calculated by deducting the uptick volume of a security or asset by the security’s downtick volume over a period of time chosen by the trader. It separates itself from other volume indicators because it makes a clear distinction between whether a market is bullish or bearish. Traders will most likely see net volume displayed below the price chart and bars will display its value for each given period that is plotted on the chart. 

#### Takeaways

Traders usually use the net volume indicator to determine market direction and sentiment apart from standard volume values. A positive net volume may show that uptick and buying pressure is exceeding downtick and selling pressure in an asset. A negative net volume may show the opposite. Net volume is meant to gauge the selling or buying pressure of an asset during a specific period of time.

#### What to look for

Net volume can be used to gauge, measure, and determine the strength and volume of buying or selling pressure. It is a different way to visualize where the buyers and sellers are putting the most money to work at any given moment. Net volume can be compared and contrasted volume, which just shows total shares traded. However, Net volume is different in its calculation using uptick and downtick and its presentation on the chart. 

#### Summary

Net volume is a technical analysis indicator that subtracts the uptick volume of a security or asset from the security’s downtick volume over a specified period of time. The net volume can be seen below the price chart and exclusively identifies the volume of a specific single time frame chosen by the trader.

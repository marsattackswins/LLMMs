Seasonals are charts of price changes observed over the same period (season) in different years. They are built for each year and compared with similar charts for other years in the same coordinate space. This tool allows you to visualize seasonal price trends and evaluate the regularity of particular dynamics, identifying patterns expected at a specific time of the year.

TradingView's seasonality charts are annual, which means that one chart shows the price dynamics of an instrument for the entire year. Each year in a given range corresponds to its line on the chart.

You can view seasonality charts for the last three years on the “Overview” tab of the symbol page and the watchlist’s symbol info section that you can find in the right panel.

These charts are for reference only and cannot be changed. To open standalone "Seasonals" page with the ability to customize the chart, click the “More seasonals” button in the widget or go to the [“Seasonals” tab of the symbol page](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/USOIL/seasonals/?exchange=TVC).

The "Seasonals" page provides access to the instrument's full data history. You can select the desired period of available history for analysis.

To set the start and end years for which the price charts will be plotted, pull the extreme points of the slider above the chart. You can also move the slider forward or backward along the time axis by clicking in the middle of the slider and dragging it. In this case, the number of years it covers will remain unchanged, and the range will be moved to the specified location of the time scale.

Click the "Percentage" button to change the price axis mode. When the button is active, the price change is displayed in percentages from the beginning of the year. When the button is inactive, the Percentage mode is disabled and the price change is presented in absolute values.

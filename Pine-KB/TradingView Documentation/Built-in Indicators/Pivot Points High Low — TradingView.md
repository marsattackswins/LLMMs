#### DefinitionÂ 

The Pivot Points High Low indicator is used to determine and anticipate potential changes in market price and reversals. The Highs referred to in the title are created based on the number of bars that exhibit lower highs on either side of a Pivot Point High, whereas the Lows are created based on the number of bars that exhibit higher lows on either side of a Pivot Point Low.

#### Calculations

As mentioned above, Pivot Point Highs are calculated by the number of bars with lower highs on either side of a Pivot Point High calculation. Similarly, Pivot Point Lows are calculated by the number of bars with higher lows on either side of a Pivot Point Low calculation.

#### Takeaways and what to look for

A Pivot Point is more significant or noteworthy if the trend is extended or longer than average. This can mean if a trader selects a higher period for before and after the Pivot Point, the trend could be longer and therefore prove the Pivot Point itself more notable.

Additionally, Pivot Points can help a trader assess where would be best to draw. By analyzing price changes and reversals, a trader has more of an ability to determine and predict price patterns and general price trends.

#### Summary

The Pivot Points High Low indicator can predict and determine price changes and potential reversals in the market. Pivot Points can also help traders identify price patterns and trends, depending on the period and significance of the Pivot Point value.

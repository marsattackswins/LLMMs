#### Summary

The Moving Average cross indicator is as simple as it sounds. It measures two moving averages and detects moments when they cross. The two moving averages being measured are the MA9 and MA21. A cross means that either the MA9 is now higher than the MA21 or vice versa. The indicator can be used alongside other moving averages or trend following indicators to create a better picture of momentum.

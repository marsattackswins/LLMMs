#### Definition

The Chop Zone is a visual indicator that was designed to analyze trends and identify their choppiness. Chop Zone is plotted within levels -100/+100 and signals to the differences between close price and its Exponential Moving Average (EMA) by converting the values calculated into colors. 

#### History 

The Chop Zone inherited its name from the Choppiness Index, which was created by E.W. Dreiss, an Australian commodity trader.

#### Takeaways

The Chop Zone indicator allows traders and analysts to determine whether or not a market is choppy, showcasing a sideways trend, or not choppy, showcasing a directional trend. 

The Choppiness Index is a range-bound oscillator and therefore, has values that fall within a certain range. As mentioned above, that range falls between -100/+100.

#### What to look for

The Chop Zone works in a way that the closer the calculated value is to 100, the higher the level of registered choppiness. In this case, choppiness refers to the sideways movement of a trend. In the other direction, the closer the calculated value is to -100, the stronger the market trend - directional movement of the trend. Little residual choppiness is registered in this case.

More often than not, traders and technical analysts use a threshold of sorts to indicate market trends that are becoming more and more choppy. These are often in the higher zones of market trend data. In turn, there is a threshold in the lower zone that indicates towards directional trends - not choppy.

#### Summary

The Chop Zone analyzes trends and indicates whether or not a trend is choppy or not. This indicator allows its users to determine the overall direction of a trend and is often associated with the Choppiness Index, a range-bound oscillator using values from -100/+100, used to analyze the range of a choppy trend.

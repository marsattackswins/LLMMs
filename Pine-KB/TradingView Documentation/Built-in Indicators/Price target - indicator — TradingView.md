The Price target indicator displays predictions for the price of the current symbol in a year’s time. The values are based on price predictions by various analysts, which our financial data supplier provides to us. The Forecast section of the symbol page shows the same data, if it is available.

The indicator highlights three price target levels: Max, Avg, and Min. The labels drawn at these levels show the expected percentage change, while the levels themselves indicate the highest, average, and lowest predicted prices for the current symbol. Dotted lines connect the levels to the day when the prediction was made.

Hovering over the blue circle – the origin point of all the lines – displays a tooltip with additional information about the prediction, including the number of analysts whose predictions were taken into account.

If the predictions are supplied when the market is closed, they appear in the symbol page but do not appear in the indicator until the market opens. If no predictions are available, the indicator displays a message to this effect instead of the lines and labels.

#### Positive/Negative Color

The colors for the lines, labels, and fills. If the predicted price is above the closing price of the symbol on the day that the prediction was made, then the drawings use the positive color. If the price is below the close, they use the negative color.

Changing the transparency of the color affects only the fill between the lines, because none of the other drawings use transparency. Changing the color affects all drawings.

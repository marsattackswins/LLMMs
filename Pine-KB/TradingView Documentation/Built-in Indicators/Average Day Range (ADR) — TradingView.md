#### Definition

Average Day Range is an indicator that measures the volatility of an asset. It shows the average movement of the price between the high and the low over the last several days.

#### Calculations

To calculate the average value for a particular day, the indicator first calculates the average among the high values of the price for a given number of days, then the average among the low values for the same number of days. Then it finds the difference between these values.

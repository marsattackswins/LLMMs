#### Takeaways

The strategy generates an order for a long position when a “Strong Buy” signal appears and an order for a short position when a “Strong Sell” signal appears in the Technical Ratings indicator. A signal is generated for a group of indicators. Using the “Rating is based on” input, you can select a group of indicators used to generate the signal.

For all orders opened by the strategy, a fixed stop loss is set at the level of 3 \* ATR(14) and a trailing stop, which is activated when the profit is equal to 5 \* ATR(14) and is set at the level of 2 \* ATR(14) of the maximum profit after the activation level.

**Note:** TradingView does not recommend that anyone buy or sell any financial instrument based solely on the recommendations of the Technical Ratings indicator. Recommendations merely indicate the fulfillment of certain conditions of a set of individual indicators that may help the user to spot potentially favorable conditions for a transaction, if this is consistent with his/her strategy.

#### Definition

The OutSide Bar strategy compares the bar's high and low values with those of the previous bar. If the current high is higher than the previous one and the current low is lower than the previous one, the strategy will enter a position. This means the current bar can fit the previous one 'inside' it. The direction depends on the bar itself: if the bar is green, it will enter long. On a red bar, a short position will be entered.

#### Summary

The OutSide Bar strategy is one way to bet on who is in control - the bulls or the bears. The strategy looks for bars that are larger than the bar before it and that move in the same direction. Whether the strategy enters long or short after that depends on the bar itself: if the bar is green, it will enter long. On a red bar, a short position will be entered.

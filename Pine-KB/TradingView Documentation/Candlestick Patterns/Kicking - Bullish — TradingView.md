The second day is a [bullish marubozu pattern](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?solution=43000583786), with next to no upper or lower shadow and where the price opens at the day’s low and closes at the day’s high.

This gap or window, as the Japanese call it, lies between day one and day two’s bullish candlesticks.

A doji candle forms when the open and close of a security are essentially equal to each other. The length of both upper and lower shadows may vary, causing the candlestick you are left with to either resemble a cross, an inverted cross, or a plus sign. Doji candles show the playout of buyer-seller indecision in a tug-of-war of sorts. As price moves either above or below the opening level during the session, the close is either at or near the opening level.

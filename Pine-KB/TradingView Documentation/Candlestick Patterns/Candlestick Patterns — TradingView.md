A candlestick pattern is a price movement that is shown graphically on a candlestick chart. In technical analysis, candlestick patterns are used to predict future price movements based on the current chart trend. On TradingView, you can use Candlestick Pattern indicators to find these patterns on the chart.

Candlestick charts first appeared in Japan in the 18th century and are still used by millions of traders today. Although the movements of such charts often seem random, they sometimes form patterns that traders use for technical analysis.

These patterns are divided between bullish and bearish signals. Bullish patterns indicate that a security’s price is likely to go up, whereas bearish patterns indicate that the security’s price is likely to go down.

#### How do I use candlestick pattern indicators?

To add candle pattern indicators to the chart, go ahead and open Indicators and Strategies menu. From there, go to the Candlestick Patterns tab to see a list of all indicators currently available in this category. Select which pattern indicators you’d like to use from there.

If the indicator finds a candlestick pattern, a special label will appear on the chart: blue for Bullish indicators, red for Bearish indicators, or gray for indicators that can show both Bullish and Bearish signals.

#### How do I receive an alert notification when a candlestick pattern forms?

The candle pattern search indicators work together with the alert system, so if you want to receive a notification every time a candle pattern appears on the chart, you can create a new alert via our Create Alert menu. To do this, you’ll need to add an indicator to the chart and then select it as an alert condition, as shown in the image below.

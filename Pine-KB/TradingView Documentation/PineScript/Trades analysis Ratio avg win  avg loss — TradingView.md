The average value of how many currency units you win for every unit you lose (in the selected currency). This is calculated by dividing the average winning trade by the average losing trade. This field is not a very meaningful value by itself because it does not take into account the ratio of the number of winning vs losing trades, and strategies can have different approaches to profitability. A strategy may trade at every possibility in order to capture many small profits, yet have an average losing trade greater than the average winning trade. The higher this value is, the better, but it should be considered together with the percentage of winning trades and the net profit.

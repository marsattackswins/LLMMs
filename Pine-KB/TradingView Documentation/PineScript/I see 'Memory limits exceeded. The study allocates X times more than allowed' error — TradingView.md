There is a memory limit for Pine indicators and strategies, to ensure the continued availability of computing resources for all TradingView users. If a script requires more memory than the allocated amount, it raises a runtime error. 

If you have access to the source code, resolve the error by optimizing the code logic to consume less memory, as described in [this PineScript™ User Manual article](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/error-messages/#memory-limits-exceeded-the-study-allocates-x-times-more-than-allowed). Otherwise, inform the script’s author of the error.

I see 'Pine cannot determine the referencing length of a series. Try using max\_bars\_back' error

I see ‘Max depth of child study reached’ error

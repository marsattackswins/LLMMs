Information from each tab is exported separately: if you click on the "Download" button from the "List of Trades" tab, you will only export the trade information. Exporting strategy data from the "Performance Summary" tab will only export the metrics.

Please note that this feature is only available for users with Plus and Premium subscriptions.

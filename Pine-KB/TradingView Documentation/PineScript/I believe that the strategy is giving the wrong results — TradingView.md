Please note that there are many factors that can affect strategy calculation results and even the tiniest of discrepancies may lead to a big difference in the outputs. See some examples of this below:

**Chart reloading/reopening.** Historical data may differ slightly from the data that is collected in real-time. Even if they match, in some cases, historical data is altered by data vendors. Different data = different backtesting results.

**Intrabar price movement.** When a strategy is calculated in real-time, we have a clear understanding of how the current price was moving between OHLC. When a strategy is applied to a chart, we don't have this information, thus we use [assumptions](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/v4/essential/strategies/#strategies). These assumptions might be wrong and they are definitely not 100% accurate even if the price was indeed moving exactly this way.

**Specific functions in the source code.** Some functions behave differently in real-time vs. historical calculation due to their internal logic. An example of such a function would be '[security](https://www.tradingview.com/study-script-reference/#fun_security)'. This peculiarity is calledÂ _Repainting_, you can find out more about it in [our user manual](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/v4/essential/indicator-repainting/).

**Strategy calculation frequency.** During historical backtesting, a strategy is always calculated only on close of every candle, while when the data updates in real-time, the same strategy might be [set to be calculated with every price update](https://www.tradingview.com/pine-script-docs/v4/essential/strategies/#strategies).

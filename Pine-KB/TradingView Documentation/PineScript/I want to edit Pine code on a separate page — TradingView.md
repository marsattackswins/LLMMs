When coding with Pine Script®, you often need space to both see your code and the chart where it runs. The default Pine Editor is displayed under the chart, which, depending on your screen, might not be too convenient — making viewing your work awkward. For this reason, and because of your feedback, we developed the detach mode.

To open the Pine Editor on in a detached mode, you need to:

-   Click the "More" button (three dots) in the top right corner of the Pine Editor.
-   Select either "Open editor in new window" or "Open editor in new tab".

Whenever you open the detached tab or window from a chart, it maintains a link to that chart, allowing you to add and update scripts from the detached page. The status of the link can be found in the status line in the bottom right corner of the editor. Hovering over it further explains what it means, and what can be done to restore the link if that is possible.

The version of the script open in the detached editor is highlighted by a special symbol on the chart.

You can also use the full [Pine Logs](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000710876/) functionality in the detached editor, provided the editor is tied to a chart and the script is added to that chart. Simply click on the "Pine Logs" button in the More menu to open the panel. The Pine Logs menu will be populated with logs, provided that the script you are working with uses them.

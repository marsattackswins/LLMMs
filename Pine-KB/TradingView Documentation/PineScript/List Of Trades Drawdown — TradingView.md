In this example, we bought 1 share of AAPL at the opening on June 15 and sold it at the opening of June 22. The initial capital was $1000.

The minimum value to which the share price has decreased since the purchase is $332.58 on June 15, therefore the maximum possible loss in this transaction is $333.25 - $332.58=$0.67, for a percentage of (0.67/(333.25\*1))\*100% = 0.20%.

A trade is a pair of orders: an entry order and an exit order. Trades are arranged chronologically by execution of entry orders. By default, the last trade is at the very top of the list. You can reverse the order by clicking on the _Trade #_ button. Clicking on any entry or exit will scroll your chart to the corresponding bar.

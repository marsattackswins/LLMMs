#### Application

The Extended Line drawing tool allows you to place a line on your chart which extends indefinitely in any direction. It can be used to create your own trend line or trend channel. The key feature is that it extends indefinitely. This means that no matter how far into the future or past you move the chart, the line will still be visible, extending at the same angle as its origin.

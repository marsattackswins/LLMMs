You can add a text label to the Circle and Ellipse drawing tools.

To add text, do the following:

-   Draw a Circle or Ellipse on the chart
-   Open the drawing tool settings
-   Go to the "Text" tab
-   Add the text and click OK

You can also edit the text of a circle of ellipse directly on the chart â€“ you just need to click on the text field in the center of the drawing, and you can type.

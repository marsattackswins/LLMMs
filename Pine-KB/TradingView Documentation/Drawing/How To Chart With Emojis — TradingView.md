You can add an emoji to your chart from the Icons section on the left panel - just select the Emojis tab at the bottom of the menu to find the list of available emojis.

The other way to add an emoji to your chart is the Signpost tool, which is located on the Annotation Tools tab.

In the Style tab of the Signpost settings, check the Emoji pin checkbox and select the emoji of your choice. You can add text to the Signpost and precisely set its coordinates.

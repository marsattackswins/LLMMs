#### Application

This tool is similar to a comment. The difference is that callout allows the user to extend its point from a specific location to a more customized placement.

To add a callout, set its two points on the chart and enter text for it. As with all text tools, you can edit the text of the callout directly on the chart â€“ you just need to click on the text field, and you can type.

#### Application

A comment allows user to make a smaller, more targeted notation than a [text box](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000516983/). The "point" on the comment also allows the notation to be placed much more specifically than a [text box](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000516983/).

To add a сomment, place it on the chart and enter text for it. As with all text tools, you can edit the text of the сomment directly on the chart – you just need to click on the text field, and you can type.

#### Text

In the Text property dialog, it is possible to change the text format and appearance of a comment text container:

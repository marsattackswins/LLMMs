With TradingView's drawing tools, you can make notes, add comments, mark trends and patterns, perform measurements and forecasts, and calculate price levels. They are located on the left panel of the chart.

Any tool has style and visibility settings at different timeframes. You can change them in the menu that opens with a double-click or using the “Settings” button on the floating panel. The style can be saved to a template in order to apply it in the future with one click.

#### Application

WD Gann used innovative geometrical and numerical relationships to create several technical analysis tools to help analyze the market. The Gann Box along with the [Gann Fan](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000518151-gann-fan/) and [Gann Square](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000518149-gann-square/) is one of such powerful tool which can be used to measure and detect recurring price cycles. User can set the time and the price range for a cycle which is expected to repeat. In this sense the Gann Box is like a road map for the market which can be used to look for targets. Please note that the chart needs to be scaled properly to ensure the market has a square relationship. The box divides price and time into equal partitions, called price and time levels, and is drawn from a major pivot (either low or high).

When working with Gann's drawings, it is important to use a proper scale ratio, so that a unit of price would correspond a unit of time.  
The simplest way to determine a scale for an unknown market is to take the difference between the main points: from top to top and from the bottom to the bottom. After that, it is necessary to divide the obtained value by the time spent by the market on moving from the top to the top or, respectively, from the bottom to the bottom.  
The exact price and time levels can be set by users in accordance to their strategy. The Gann Box can be applied across various markets to forecast key price and time levels and can be used with or without angles. It can be used by itself or in combination with other tools and technical analysis techniques to find the best trades.

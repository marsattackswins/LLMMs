#### Application

Horizontal lines are often used to make a note of a specific price. They can also be very useful when marking off levels of support and resistance. Much like Extended Lines (which may be drawn in any direction), Horizontal Lines continue on in their respective direction indefinitely.

#### Text

When the _Text_ checkbox is active, a text for displaying beside the horizontal line may be entered in the text box. Text color and opacity, font size, bold and italic attribute may be assigned in the drop-downs next to the checkbox. _Text alignment_ drop-downs allow to set the text position along the horizontal line.

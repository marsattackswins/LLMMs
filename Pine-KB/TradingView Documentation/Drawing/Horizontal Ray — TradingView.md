#### Application

The Horizontal Ray drawing tool is similar to the [Horizontal Line](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?solution=43000518124) or [Ray](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?solution=43000518113) except that it only extends in one direction from left to right. The user places the origin of the ray at their discretion and the ray continues from left to right indefinitely. To draw a ray in any direction, use the [Ray](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?solution=43000518113) drawing.

Text color and opacity, font size, bold and italic attribute may be assigned in the drop-downs next to the checkbox. _Text alignment_ drop-downs allow to set the text position along the horizontal ray.

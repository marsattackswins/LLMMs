#### Application

Fibonacci extensions is a tool that traders can use to establish profit targets or estimate how far a price may move. Extension levels are also possible areas where the price is expected to reverse.

Extensions are drawn on a chart, marking the price levels of possible importance. These levels are based on Fibonacci ratios.

To draw Trend-Based Fib Extension, three points needed. Once the three points are set, the level lines are drawn up to Fibonacci sequence. The first point chosen is the start of a move, the second point is the end of a move, and the third point is the end of the retracement against that move. The extensions then help project where the price could go next.

#### Application

The Ray is similar to the [Horizontal Ray](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000518121/) except that it can be orientated in any direction. The first point of a ray defines the origin, and the second point defines the direction. To draw it, place the initial point at any location on the chart and the second point in the desired direction. The ray will extend in that direction indefinitely.

#### Application

The ABCD Pattern drawing tool allows analysts to highlight various four point chart patterns. Users can manually draw and maneuver the four separate points (ABCD). The ABCD points create three separate legs which combine to form chart patterns. The three legs are referred to as AB, BC, and CD.

Each of the four points (ABCD) represent a significant high or low in terms of price on the chart. Therefore, the three previously mentioned legs (AB, BC, CD) represent different trends or price movements which move in opposite directions.

As a result there are three major ABCD chart patterns that are most common. These patterns can be either bullish or bearish. It is important to note that it would be extremely rare for line lengths and ratios to ever be exactly equal. Technical analysis such as this is simply not an exact science. Because of this, some experimentation may be necessary.

#### The three major patterns include:

1.  AB=CD
2.  Classic ABCD
3.  ABCD Extension

#### AB=CD

Both the time and length of AB equal the time and length of CD.

#### Classic ABCD

CD should be either 127.2% or 161.8% of BC.

#### ABCD Extension

CD should be either 127.2% or 161.8% of AB.

##### Price 1

Allows for the precise placement of the pattern's first point (Price 1) using a bar number and price.

##### Price 2

Allows for the precise placement of the pattern's second point (Price 2) using a bar number and price.

##### Price 3

Allows for the precise placement of the pattern's third point (Price 3) using a bar number and price.

##### Price 4

Allows for the precise placement of the pattern's fourth point (Price 4) using a bar number and price.

#### Visibility

In Visibility properties dialog you can switch the ABCD tool displaying on charts of different timeframes:

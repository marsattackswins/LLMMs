#### Application

A Fib Wedge is a set of arcs spreading out of the point of a trend's beginning. These arcs are placed on levels formed by a Fibonacci number series.

Generally, the Fib Wedge is a kind of analogue of the [Fib Retracement](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000518158-fib-retracement/).  
The Fib Wedge determines the end of correction and support levels. It is drawn according to the trend movement (two points) and wedge arcs for visual analysis of the chart.  
A wedge becomes more convenient if its borders are carried out with a margin, so that the price is approximately in the middle of the wedge, and the upper arc touches the extreme price.

#### Style

In the Style property dialog it is possible to change the appearance and configuration of a Fib Wedge:

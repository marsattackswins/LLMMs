#### Application

The XABCD Pattern drawing tool allows analysts to highlight various five point chart patterns. Users can manually draw and maneuver the five separate points (XABCD). The XABCD points create four separate legs, which combine to form chart patterns. The four legs are referred to as XA, AB, BC, and CD.

Each of the five points (XABCD) represent a significant high or low in terms of price on the chart. Therefore, the four previously mentioned legs (XA, AB, BC, CD) represent different trends or price movements which move in opposite directions.

As a result, there are four major XABCD chart patterns that are most common. These patterns can be either bullish or bearish.

The four major patterns include:

1.  Gartley
2.  Butterfly
3.  Crab
4.  Bat

##### Gartley

For this example we will examine a Bullish Gartley Pattern:

1.  The pattern begins with an uptrend designated as XA.
2.  Price reverses back down at A and stops at B. The Fibonacci Retracement ration of AB should be 61.8% of the price range of A minus X.
3.  Price reverses at B. The BC retracement should be between 61.8% and 78.6% of the AB price range (not the length of the lines). This is shown along the line AC.
4.  At C, price reverses with retracement CD between 127% and 161.8% of the range BC. This is shown along the line BD.
5.  Price D is the point to enter the market (buy).

##### Butterfly

For this example we will examine a Bullish Butterfly Pattern:

1.  The swing from A to D should be a 127.2% or 161.8% extension of the XA line.
2.  Within the A to D swing, a valid ABCD pattern must be observed.
3.  In an ideal setup, the two triangles (XAB and BCD) should be almost equal in terms of time. If not look for the second triangle (BCD) to be between 61.8% and 161.8% of the first triangle (XAB).
4.  A move beyond 161.8% would suggest that the bullish pattern is broken and bearish movement may be inevitable.

##### Crab

1.  AB should be the 0.382 or 0.618 retracement of the XA line.
2.  BC should be either the 0.382 or 0.886 retracement of the AB line.
3.  CD is the 2.24 or 9.64 extension of the BC line.

##### Bat

1.  AB is the 0.382 or 0.500 retracement of the XA line.
2.  BC is the 0.382 or 0.886 retracement of the AB line.
3.  CD can be either the 1.618 or 2.618 extension of the BC line.

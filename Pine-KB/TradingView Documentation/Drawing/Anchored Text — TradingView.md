#### Application

The anchored text box is just like a standard text box except that it is anchored to the screen. What this means is that the anchored text box will stay visible on the chart and doesn't scroll with a series, no matter how far into the past or future you scroll the chart:

To add anchored text, place it on the chart and enter text for it. As with all text tools, you can edit the anchored text directly on the chart â€“ you just need to click on the text field, and you can type.

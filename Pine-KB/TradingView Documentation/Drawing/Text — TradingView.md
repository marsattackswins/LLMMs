#### Application

A text box instrument allows the user to make annotations on the chart easily. Unlike the [anchored text box](https://www.tradingview.com/support/solutions/43000516974-anchored-text/), this standard text box is attached to a certain point on a chart and moves along with the chart as the user scrolls it into the past or future. This means that the text box may get out of view.

To add text, place it on the chart and enter its content. As with all text tools, you can edit the text directly on the chart â€“ you just need to click on the text field, and you can type.

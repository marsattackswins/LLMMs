#### Application

The polyline drawing tool is a way to draw a custom shape while still using straight lines. Any shape made from straight lines can be drawn and once the last point is connected with the first point of the figure, the shape will be completed. You can also finish drawing the polyline by double-clicking, right-clicking, or pressing the _Esc_Â key - in this case the shape will remain open.

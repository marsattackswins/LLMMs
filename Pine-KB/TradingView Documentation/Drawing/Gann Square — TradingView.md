#### Application

The Gann Square is one of the best known technical analysis tools created by WD Gann along with the Gann Fan and Gann Box. It is considered a cornerstone of his trading technique that is based on time and price symmetry. The Gann Square is an advanced tool and using it properly requires a base level of knowledge about Gann theory and some experience with charting. Please note that the chart needs to be scaled properly to ensure the market has a square relationship. The tool uses the Gann Wheel as a basis for its patterns of price and time. It can be used in a variety of ways.  
One way is to start at the previous major pivot point (normally the end of the last 5 wave sequence) and draw it so that the 1 X 1 line follows the current market support areas to a good degree. Another way is to highlight geometric formations that can forecast key support and resistance levels by counting forward from the all-time low or all-time high. 

When working with Gann's drawings, it is important to use the proper scale ratio, so that a unit of price would correspond a unit of time.

The simplest way to determine a scale for an unknown market is to take the difference between the main points: from top to top and from the bottom to the bottom. After that, it is necessary to divide the obtained value by the time spent by the market on moving from the top to the top or, respectively, from the bottom to the bottom.

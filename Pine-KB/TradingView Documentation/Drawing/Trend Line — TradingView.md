#### Application

The Trend Line drawing tool has several useful applications. It is predominantly used to manually draw lines illustrating trends in the market or associated indicators. It can also be used as arrows (there is an option to put an arrow on one or both ends) which are used to designate points of interest. To draw a trend line at 45-degree angle, keep the Shift key pressed while drawing.

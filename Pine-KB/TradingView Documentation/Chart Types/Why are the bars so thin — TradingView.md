In technical analysis, you often need the ability to get accurate information about price movements quickly. Thin bars allow you to visually determine the levels (open, high, low, close) in as concise a format as possible, making it easier to read information faster.

In our thin bars mode, the opening and closing price notches are accurately drawn at the corresponding levels. When the thin bars mode is disabled, a small horizontal line can cross several price values.

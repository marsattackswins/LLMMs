Tick charts are currently in BETA, meaning they're under development, and our team is gradually improving their functionality. We've planned several updates to this feature, including eventual support for tick-based Renko, Line Break, Kagi, and PnF charts.Â 

If you experience an issue with tick-based intervals or have feedback, please share it with us by submitting a support ticket.

The Trading View platform allows market data analyzation using various types of charts. Conventionally, they can be divided into two categories.

Traditional charts, the construction of which depends on time:

-   Bars
-   Candles 
-   Hollow candles 
-   Volume candles
-   Line
-   Line with markers
-   Step line
-   Area
-   HLC area
-   Baseline 
-   Columns
-   High-low
-   Volume footprint
-   Time Price Opportunity
-   Session volume profile

And charts, the construction of which depends only on price changes:

-   Heikin Ashi 
-   Renko
-   Line break 
-   Kagi 
-   Point & figure 
-   Range

The desired chart type can be selected from the drop-down menu on the top toolbar.

This chart type is based on three price values: High, Low and Close.

It allows you to focus on the most important data and disregard the open price value that is less significant for analysis.

If it is more useful for you to see the range of price movement on a selected interval, the HLC area chart type in the form of a shaded area comes in handy.

You can select this type of chart in the same place as the others â€“ in the chart type menu on the top toolbar.

Area charts are similar to line charts, but there’s a key difference: the area underneath the price line is shaded in to fill in the space from the price line and the bottom of the scale. It is meant to give the perspective of how high or low the price has gone. This chart is very easy to read and is usually used for creating reports.

The first section, Area, lists settings specific to the chart type:

1.  Price source. Choose the price you want the chart to show. By default, it is set to close price, meaning the chart will be formed with the closing prices of an asset. According to your trading style, choose the desired price:
    1.  Open. The chart will show the opening prices.
    2.  High. Shows only the highest prices.
    3.  Low. Shows only the lowest prices.
    4.  Close. Shows only the closing prices.
    5.  (H + L)/2. Shows the average of the highest and lowest prices.
    6.  (H + L + C)/3. Shows the average of the highest, lowest, and closing prices.
    7.  (O + H + L + C)/4. Shows the average of the opening, highest, lowest, and closing prices.
2.  Line. With this setting on, the color of the line, its thickness, and opacity can be changed according to your preferences.
3.  Fill. Change the colors of the filled in area underneath the line and their opacity.

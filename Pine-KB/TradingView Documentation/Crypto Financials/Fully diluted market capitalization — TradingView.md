#### What is “FD market cap”?

Fully diluted market cap – the market capitalization of the cryptocurrency if the entire future supply of coins (max or total) was in circulation.

#### Why is “FD market cap” important?

Fully diluted market capitalization is an important metric because it allows investors to take into account the rate of issuance of new coins and assess the impact of inflation on the value of a coin.

#### How is “FD market cap” calculated?

Fully diluted market capitalization  = Current Price \* Max supply.

#### Why is there no FD market cap for some coins (f.e. Doge)?

If a white paper of the coin doesn’t specify the maximum supply, then this variable will not be available and FD MCAP can’t be calculated.

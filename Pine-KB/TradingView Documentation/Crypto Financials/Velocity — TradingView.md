#### What is "Velocity"?

Velocity is a measure of how quickly coins are circulating in the network, and is calculated by dividing the on-chain transaction volume (in USD) by the market cap (i.e., the inverse of the NVT Ratio). If transactions are absent, then the token lacks liquidity and its velocity equals zero.

#### Why is "Velocity" important?

Token velocity is important because it shows investors how volatile their money is in their choice cryptocurrency. If the tokens increase at a rapid rate, investors will likely sell their tokens for cash. This causes the tokenâ€™s value in the market to drop.

#### What is the formula for "Velocity"?

Velocity = 1 / NVT = Transaction volume in USD / Market capitalization in USD

#### What is “AltRank™”?

This metric, developed by Lunarcrush, evaluates the popularity and activity of a cryptocurrency project compared to other projects in the market. It is based on four main components: trading volume on exchanges, social media activity, price change relative to Bitcoin, and overall social ranking. 

#### Why is “AltRank™” important?

“AltRank™” helps highlight cryptocurrencies gaining momentum and attention. Being in the top 25 ranking suggests that a project is active in trading and social media and outperforming others in the engagement and interest of the crypto community. This can strongly indicate the project’s growth potential, making it helpful in spotting promising opportunities early.

A white paper is a detailed document that outlines the concept, technology, goals, and implementation strategy of a cryptocurrency or project. It delves into the project's vision, underlying blockchain technology, tokenomics, use cases, market analysis, competitive landscape, and roadmap. White Papers provide potential investors, developers, and stakeholders with an in-depth understanding of the project's value proposition, technical aspects, and long-term plans. They serve as a foundational document that communicates the project's objectives and serves as a reference point for evaluating its viability and potential impact.

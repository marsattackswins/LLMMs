The source code refers to the underlying programming instructions and logic that powers a cryptocurrency or project. It is typically stored in a repository, such as GitHub, and is publicly available for developers to review, audit, modify, and contribute to the codebase. Open-source projects encourage transparency, collaboration, and community involvement, as developers can suggest improvements, report bugs, and propose new features based on the source code.

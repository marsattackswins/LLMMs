[Commitment of Traders (COT) data](https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/index.htm) is tallied by the [Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)](https://www.cftc.gov/), a US federal agency that oversees the trading of derivative markets such as futures in the US. It is weekly data that provides traders with information about [open interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/openinterest.asp) for an asset. The CFTC oversees derivative markets traded on different exchanges, so COT data is available for assets that can be traded on CBOT, CME, NYMEX, COMEX, and ICEUS.

A detailed description of the COT report can be found on the [CFTC's website](https://www.cftc.gov/MarketReports/CommitmentsofTraders/index.htm).

COT data is separated into three notable reports: Legacy, Disaggregated, and Financial. This data is accessible on TradingView via four separate indicators published from the official TradingView account. A brief description of each indicator can be found below; click on a link to open the publication page where each indicator is described in more detail.

[Commitment of Traders: Total](https://www.tradingview.com/script/CQBbeOHQ-Commitment-of-Traders-Total/) presents specific data from the COT Legacy report. The Total data details the positions held by various traders: Commercial Hedgers (traders registered with CFTC that use futures contracts in that particular commodity for hedging), Large Traders (traders registered with CFTC that do not hedge that particular commodity) and Small Traders (not registered with CFTC).

[Commitment of Traders: Legacy Metrics](https://www.tradingview.com/script/195p3YlK-Commitment-of-Traders-Legacy-Metrics/) presents data from the legacy report, which is broken down by exchange. Legacy reports break down the reportable open interest positions into two classifications: non-commercial and commercial traders.

[Commitment of Traders: Disaggregated Metrics](https://www.tradingview.com/script/QmIAaONl-Commitment-of-Traders-Disaggregated-Metrics/) presents data from the Disaggregated report. The disaggregated reports are broken down by agriculture, petroleum and products, natural gas and products, electricity and metals and other physical contracts. The Disaggregated reports break down the reportable open interest positions into four classifications: Producer/Merchant/Processor/User, Swap Dealers, Managed Money, and Other Reportables.

[Commitment of Traders: Financial Metrics](https://www.tradingview.com/script/9wP2dU52-Commitment-of-Traders-Financial-Metrics/) presents data from the COT Financial (Traders in Financial Futures) report. The Financial report includes financial contracts, such as currencies, US Treasury securities, Eurodollars, stocks, VIX and Bloomberg commodity index. As such, the TFF data is limited to financial-related tickers. The TFF report breaks down the reportable open interest positions into four classifications: Dealer/Intermediary, Asset Manager/Institutional, Leveraged Funds, and Other Reportables.

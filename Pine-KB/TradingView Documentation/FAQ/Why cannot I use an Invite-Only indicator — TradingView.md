Invite-only indicators (the ones that have a lock icon next to their title)  are published by our users in the Community Scripts. Access to such indicators is not included in any plan because they have not been created and built-in by TradingView. If you want to get access to such scripts, you should contact their authors and ask them to give you access to them. By the way,  the author’s name is displayed next to the indicator (strategy) title.

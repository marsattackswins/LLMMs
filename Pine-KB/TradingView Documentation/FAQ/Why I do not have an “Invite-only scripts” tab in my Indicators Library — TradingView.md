This tab appears as soon as a user is given access to an Invite-Only script (access to such indicator is given only by its author). Therefore if this tab is not shown in your Indicators Library, it means that you have not been given permission to use any Invite-Only script.

Was this solution helpful?

I see a "Smoothing" section in an indicator's settings. What does it do?

Why cannot I use an Invite-Only indicator?
